\subsection{Vault of the Shadow Gate}

Water and mud have slid down the stairs of the Shadow Vault for the last couple of centuries.
Most of the year, the temple has deep water.
However, during the cold seasons, the water freezes over.



\mapentry[entranceCullis]{Rusted Portcullis}

The rope to life the portcullis has long ago vanished.
The slow movement of earth above has sealed the metal bars in place.
They have barely rusted, suggesting good quality steel.

\mapentry[shadowPot]{Sticky Pot}

This ceramic pot has a thick seal of ropes and wax, and will not open easily.
The ooze which inhabits the deeper water \vpageref{shadowJelly} occasionally comes out, and leaves acidic mucus all over the pot, presumably sensing the contents.

Inside, rests a tiny little ooze-creature, under a \textit{Preservation} spell, ensuring it will not age so long as it remains still.
The temple \glspl{server} placed it here `in case of emergency', with a vague plan to make the entrance extremely dangerous if anything large entered.

\mapentry[shadowOaths]{Lady of Oaths}

\begin{exampletext}
  `Wouldn't it be great if people could just keep their promises?', is the kind of thing that people say when they don't think about the consequences.
  One alchemist, who thought he was being clever, created \pgls{artefact} which would listen to people's oaths, promises, or intentions.
  The \gls{artefact} still thinks people should keep their word, but like any \gls{artefact}, has no concept of context or priorities.

  So whenever anyone states their intentions next to her, she casts an \textit{Oath} spell, ensuring that they will keep their word.
  If they try, but struggle, she may well aid them with more spells, but if they try to avoid doing what they said, she turns to unfriendly spells.

  The creator abandoned the \gls{artefact} in frustration shortly after making it, then sold it to the Shadow Vault, where it stood as a visitors' attraction.

\mapentry[shadowJelly]{Lowly Ooze}

An acidic ooze sits down here, minding its own business.
Occasionally a woodspy or basilisk enters to look around or hibernate, and the ooze begins to eat it.
And sometimes that creature escapes, and sometimes it does not.

The ooze has existed here for a long time, and has grown very large.

\jelly[\npc{\A}{Uncommonly Large Ooze}\setcounter{r4}{5}]

The \glspl{pc} may find the ooze a serious problem.
It's deadly, humongous, hungry, and fearless.
But like any ooze, it's stupid, so the \glspl{pc} can lead it out of the temple, and the only way it can find its way back is to feel its own slime-trail.

\paragraph{During cold seasons,}
the ooze rests under the ice.

The entrance to the Shadow Gate (\vpageref{shadowGate}) stands about as tall as a human, under the ice.
\Glspl{pc} won't see the entrance easily, and will have to smash the ice open to gain access -- \roll{Strength}{Crafts} (\tn[10])\ldots which of course releases the ooze.

\mapentry[shadowGate]{Shadow Gate}

Stairs along the causeway lead to two raised platforms, still blessedly dry.
Each has little walls to contain all the sand.

When the Shadow Gate wishes to speak, it uses a \textit{Warp Detailed Earth} spell to solidify and soften different parts of the sand, which spells out a riddle.

The Shadow Gate's last riddle remains on the floor, but this riddle has multiple stages, so once someone begins to answer the riddle, the sand will start to shift about.

\mapentry[shadowGuardian]{Sleeping Guardians}

\begin{exampletext}
  When the magical gateway shut, the local \gls{warden} tasked \pgls{doula} to resolve the situation.
  Like anyone in her position, she told an enchanting story about success, then delegated the task.

  Finding three people too young to know better, she arranged for some very fancy clothes, and declared them `Masters of the Riddle', and `Keepers of the Gate'.
  Then she sent them into an enchanted state, preserving their bodies, and setting their minds to focus, without failure, on the single task of solving the riddle which had vexed all of \gls{valley}.

  The first thought about how much he hated Maths.
  The second thought about visualizing the riddle as a series of rivers, each one representing a possible set of questions and answers.
  The third had already gone to sleep to dream of sex with his attractive neighbour.

  With everyone's attention focussed on the `Masters of the Riddle', the \gls{doula} went home, and died peacefully shortly after.

  The three rest in this hidden room to this day.
\end{exampletext}

\mapentry[shadowDesk]{Empty Desks}

\begin{exampletext}
  This room once had a steep stone staircase up to it.
  But with the guardians (\vpageref[above]{shadowGuardian}) sleeping peacefully, the proprietor didn't want leave them unprotected (even with the gate present).
  So he ordered men to build a wall over the entrance, leaving a gap at the top so they could squeeze out.
\end{exampletext}

The entrance stands at almost double the height of a human, and only wide enough to crawl through, so not many will spot it.
(and anyone with a Strength of +4 will have to remove their armour to fit through)

Once the \glspl{pc} pass by the entrance, they can make a single roll for both checks.

With \roll{Wits}{Crafts} (\tn[14]) they might notice the bricks are a little different around that wall.

With \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} (\tn[12]) they see the small entrance, above.
