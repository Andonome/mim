\sidequest[Roads,Forest]{Entitlement}

\noindent
The \gls{whiteplains} \glspl{warden} cannot survive the tax hikes imposed on them when taking their boats through \gls{town}, so they have sent two of their most devious agitators to stir up trouble.
A \pgls{guard} \gls{jotter} -- \glsentrytext{traitor} -- has decided to join them, in return for promotion to Overseer once they have risen to power, and become \glspl{warden} of \gls{town}, and \gls{valley}.

Throughout this story, they slowly dismantle the existing power structures.

{Rotten Breath}% NAME
{\Glsentrytext{traitor} sends the party to find a cure for his breath}% SUMMARY

\Pgls{traitor}

\label{rottenBreath}
\begin{exampletext}
  When \pgls{guard} Rider reported finding a ruined temple%
  \footnote{See \vpageref{necromancers_lair}.}
  to \gls{traitor}, he went to investigate with \gls{sewerking}.
  At first, it appeared abandoned, so \gls{sewerking} picked up some interesting items he found in the hall.

  A moment later, a swarm of stirges swarmed around \gls{traitor}, and their bite carried an infection.
  \Gls{traitor} now has \textit{Breath Rot}.
  The two fled, carrying statues and a magical \gls{artefact}%
  \footnote{See \vpageref{The Bladder Skull}.}
  but \gls{traitor} still has foul breath from a disease which will slowly suffocate him to death.
\end{exampletext}

The \gls{jotter} awakens the troupe rudely, and gives them a foul lecture, with stinking breath.
He needs them to march, as fast as they can, and go to a spot past the \gls{edge} where Screeching Moss%
\exRef{judgement}{Judgement}{screeching_moss}
grows.
Screech Moss is the only thing \gls{traitor} knows about which can cure his disease.

How far the \glspl{pc} must march depends on where they start, and how well they can navigate,%
\exRef{core}{Core Rules}{navigate_land}
but the moss should be somewhere close.

\paragraph{If the troupe fetch the moss within a couple of days,}
\gls{traitor} rewards them with a longsword each, then asks them to go immediately to \gls{town} to request \gls{forestpriest} create a cure for him, and gives them a single note stating they have official business.%
\footnote{The \gls{guard} should not usually enter towns without official business.}

\paragraph{If the troupe enter \gls{town},}
they will find \gls{forestpriest} in the \gls{doulaShop}, not far from \gls{pig}.

\paragraph{If the troupe fail to make it back within a couple of days,}
\gls{traitor} will be furious with them, but will find another group of \glspl{guard} to bring him a cure.

\begin{boxtext}
  In the far distance, a trading caravan approaches.
  You can see the head rider's long hair trailing behind him in the \showTemperature\ wind.
  Both coaches have the usual archer on the top, though they don't look like \glspl{guard}.
\end{boxtext}

{Guild Consciousness}% NAME
{\gls{sewerthief} talks politics}% SUMMARY

\Gls{sewerthief} wants a promotion, so he has taken on the dangerous mission of tracking down a griffin eyrie.
Since he's alone in the forest, he lights two fires, fairly far apart, then crawls under a little bush to hide.
His hope is that any predators in the area will wander up to the fire, and not him.

\sewerthief

\Gls{sewerthief} speaks to the troupe about \gls{lostcity}, then soon after -- politics.

\begin{speechtext}
  ``Just think about how wonderful it must be if all of this were a big city, with gardens, just like \glspl{warden} have, and we weren't sitting in the dark, away from the fires'', he moans.

  You know they say we can become \glspl{warden} by building a new \gls{village}, but I've never really seen it.
  We don't become \glspl{warden} really, and none of the \glspl{warden} I've seen ever started in the \gls{guard}.
\end{speechtext}
