\chapter{Hungry Forests}
\epigraph{Come now, my child, if we were planning to harm you, do you think we'd be lurking here beside the path in the very darkest part of the forest?}{Kenneth Patchen}

\noindent
Nobody thrives in the forest -- at best they survive.

The troupe can comfortably travel 1~mile each \gls{interval}, and every mile after that brings \pgls{ep}.%
\exRef{core}{Core Rules}{march}
Gource bushes, bogs, rivers, and suspicious noises make every step challenging.
An encounter with some creature under those conditions means further \glspl{ep}, and rethinking every plan.

As dusk falls, the world goes quickly dark, and finding the way back home becomes difficult.
Asking for an \roll{Intelligence}{Wyldcrafting} roll at \gls{tn} 14 is not unreasonable.

By night, the troupe can sleep without a fire in the warmer seasons.
But during normal weather, they will need a fire in order to get any real rest.
And of course, when it gets cold, a large fire becomes \emph{mandatory}.

Noise, fire, or anything else which might entice and excite the predators who live here, should prompt a roll of $1D6$ -- and on a `1', roll on the encounter chart.
