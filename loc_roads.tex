\section{Traders and Chimneys}
\index{Market!Roads}

The \glspl{pc} will begin on the roads -- specifically in \pgls{bothy}.
Here the \gls{jotter} will give them orders to start on various random missions.%
\exRef{judgement}{Judgement}{NGmissions}
These might be easy (accompany these traders), or more challenging (guard that \gls{village} for a week), but once they step onto the road, they should have a little freedom to engage with the various \glspl{sq} before long.

Starting characters, with a rank of `Fodder',%
\exRef{judgement}{Judgement}{fodder}
aren't officially permitted to enter towns, and should not enter \glspl{village} without explicit orders.
They may still try to sneak into towns for supplies (the \glspl{jotter} hand out supplies unwillingly or never), or might wait to gain a couple of ranks.

Once in the \glspl{village}, the \glspl{pc} will want to buy supplies.
Check the handouts to find what the \gls{village} markets have.
