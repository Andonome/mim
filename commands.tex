    {
      The target can make limited use of their normal vision, but mostly feels aware of the penetrating light given off by every soul.
      Animals emit a feint light.
      Those with a higher Charisma score tend to emanate a little more.

      The vision becomes indistinct beyond \spellRange\ -- the target understands nothing more than `something might live over there', and any life around them quickly distorts that limited vision.

      For as long as the spell remains active, the target cannot regenerate \glspl{fatigue}, \glspl{mp}, or \glspl{hp}.
      While the spell diminishes a little with every movement, but targets who remain still retain the spell's effects.
