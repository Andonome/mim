\subsection{Vault of the Shadow Gate}

Water and mud have slid down the stairs of the Shadow Vault for the last couple of centuries.
Most of the year, the temple has deep water.
However, during the cold seasons, the water freezes over.



\mapentry[entranceCullis]{Rusted Portcullis}

The rope to life the portcullis has long ago vanished.
The slow movement of earth above has sealed the metal bars in place.
They have barely rusted, suggesting good quality steel.

\mapentry[shadowPot]{Sticky Pot}

This ceramic pot has a thick seal of ropes and wax, and will not open easily.
The ooze which inhabits the deeper water \vpageref{shadowJelly} occasionally comes out, and leaves acidic mucus all over the pot, presumably sensing the contents.

Inside, rests a tiny little ooze-creature, under a \textit{Preservation} spell, ensuring it will not age so long as it remains still.
The temple \glspl{server} placed it here `in case of emergency', with a vague plan to make the entrance extremely dangerous if anything large entered.

\mapentry[shadowOaths]{Lady of Oaths}

\begin{exampletext}
  `Wouldn't it be great if people could just keep their promises?', is the kind of thing that people say when they don't think about the consequences.
  One alchemist, who thought he was being clever, created \pgls{artefact} which would listen to people's oaths, promises, or intentions.
  The \gls{artefact} still thinks people should keep their word, but like any \gls{artefact}, has no concept of context or priorities.

  So whenever anyone states their intentions next to her, she casts an \textit{Oath} spell, ensuring that they will keep their word.
  If they try, but struggle, she may well aid them with more spells, but if they try to avoid doing what they said, she turns to unfriendly spells.

  The creator abandoned the \gls{artefact} in frustration shortly after making it, then sold it to the Shadow Vault, where it stood as a visitors' attraction.

\mapentry[shadowJelly]{Lowly Ooze}

An acidic ooze sits down here, minding its own business.
Occasionally a woodspy or basilisk enters to look around or hibernate, and the ooze begins to eat it.
And sometimes that creature escapes, and sometimes it does not.

The ooze has existed here for a long time, and has grown very large.

\mapentry[shadowDesk]{Empty Desks}

\mapentry[shadowGuardian]{Sleeping Guardians}

\begin{exampletext}
  When the magical gateway shut, the local \gls{warden} tasked \pgls{doula} to resolve the situation.
  Like anyone in her position, she told an enchanting story about success, then delegated the task.

  Finding three people too young to know better, she arranged for some very fancy clothes, and declared them `Masters of the Riddle', and `Keepers of the Gate'.
  Then she sent them into an enchanted state, preserving their bodies, and setting their minds to focus, without failure, on the single task of solving the riddle which had vexed all of \gls{valley}.

  The first thought about how much he hated Maths.
  The second thought about visualizing the riddle as a series of rivers, each one representing a possible set of questions and answers.
  The third had already gone to sleep to dream of sex with his attractive neighbour.

  With everyone's attention focussed on the `Masters of the Riddle', the \gls{doula} went home, and died peacefully shortly after.

  The three rest in this hidden room to this day.
