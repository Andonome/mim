\subsection{The Market}
\label{greyMarket}
\index{Market!\glsentrytext{town}}

Every morning, wagons full of vegetables pour into \gls{town} with food from \glspl{village} and hamlets, and enter the market.
Servants of the nobles arrive to buy large baskets.
\Gls{townmaster} and the guild leaders always eat well.

The food sellers then take their coin, and move to stalls where the guilds sell their wares -- beer, armour, blessings, clothes, carts, oil, and anything else \pgls{village} might not produce.
Despite its remote location, one can buy almost anything in \gls{town}.

Next, the \glspl{sunGuard} take their share.
They may be few, but they buy a large portion with their heavy taxes on the guilds.

``No price is too high for safety'', they tell everyone inside \gls{town}'s walls.

Servants of nobles or the guild then pay for the last of the good food at the market, and return home with what they can get.
Their employment alone keeps them out of the \gls{guard}.
When servants and lower-ranking guild members misbehave, they find themselves with a quick job outside the walls.
And the worse the deed, the closer they may come to the \gls{edge}.

The last group live in a state of constant questioning.
Will they find a little work, or steal today?
If someone catches them, will it be the gallows or the guard?
If someone makes them work in the \gls{guard}, what kind of creature will eat them?

Take a look at the handouts for the \gls{town} market.

\subsection{The \Glsfmttext{paperGuild}}
\label{paperGuild}
\index{Library!Paper Guild}

This massive library contains a wealth of unsorted books in piles, stacks, shelves, and occasionally used as doorstops (when \gls{librarian}, the sorting-librarian, disapproves of the book).
Most books are arranged by size first, then either author (if the author wrote enough) or language (authors who write in multiple languages have some books placed by language first), then quality (with marks out of nineteen), and finally arranged by excellence of handwriting.

While a number of \glspl{seeker} within the \gls{paperGuild} outrank \gls{librarian}, after sorting all of the books, only she knows how to find them.
As a result, all requests must go through her, and the amount of time she takes generally depends on her disposition towards that person.

Most research rolls here can bring up any number of items -- everything might be found, if only you can find what it lies under.
Anyone in \gls{librarian}'s good graces receives a +4 Bonus to research rolls.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Researching the local area might bring up a map of the whole of \gls{valley} (\roll{Intelligence}{Wyldcrafting}, \tn[14]).
  \item
  Researching old temples of Eldren might bring up the map of \gls{necromancer}'s temple (from before it crumbled).
  \item
  Asking the young people who frequent the library about what they are doing reveals a young man who has mapped all of \gls{town} (\roll{Intelligence}{Empathy}, \tn[10]).
  \item
  Researching \gls{lostcity} yields a map of a small wing from the \gls{paperGuild} (\roll{Wits}{Academics}, \tn[18]).
  \item
  Researching old elvish settlements yields a map.
  The format makes little sense, the cartographer seems to name random places, and age has changed everything which might have been remotely useful.
  However, if you look closely, with an elvish eye, this map matches \gls{valley}.
  It also shows the location of two nura portals, marked 'gate place'.
\end{itemize}

These various maps can be found in the handouts.

\subsection{The Citadel}

\subsection{The Temple of Eldren}

The temple houses priests who write biographies (mostly for nobles), handle pensions (repaid on a per-family basis), practice starvation (so others can have more), and sing prayers for their ancestors to stay somewhere nice in the afterlife.

If the temple's groundskeeper -- Ripcrag -- ever finds out what happened to the bodies they lovingly prepare before placing in caskets, he enters a rage and demands to join the \glspl{pc} to confront the perpetrators immediately.
