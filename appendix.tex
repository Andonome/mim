\chapter{Parting Note}

There is no ending here.

I've run this campaign, start-to-finish, three times over the years.
Each time it changes a little, and always has a completely different ending.

By the time the players have made their decisions, and their characters have a reputation among the various actors and groups in the various \glspl{sq}, they could be anywhere, so I'm afraid I can't help you there, except to suggest taking stock of who's left alive, what resources they have, and what they want.

Perhaps \gls{banditking} has no troupe left and has to make a last, desperate attempt at lowering the taxes in \gls{whiteplains} by murdering \gls{townmaster}'s heir as a warning to anyone who would overburden \gls{whiteplains} again.

Perhaps \gls{banditking} arrives with a small army, and offers to clear the citadel of ghasts in order to gain the favour of everyone in \gls{town}, then begins to sweet-talk \gls{town}'s guild leaders before making a play for leadership.

Perhaps the \gls{wolfhead} and \gls{whiteBandits} join forces and both get what they want.

Or perhaps all the primary characters died at the hands of the \gls{guard}, and this campaign comes to a halt far before the last few \glspl{segment} can even start.

However it turns out, happy gaming.

\subsection{A Complete Explanation of the \Glsfmttext{deep}}

This massive tome's disorganized chapters, unreferenced references to other books, and dense diagrams make it a pain to read.
However, it promises a complete account of \gls{deep}.

The entire book tells lies from start to finish.

If players ask what's inside, tell them it holds a lot of information, and they should simply ask.
If their question ends in a vowel, say `yes', and if their question ends in a consonant, say `no'.

\begin{description}
  \itshape
  \item[Do goblins live in the \gls{deep}?]
  No, the book states that the goblins have their own realm, unrelated to the \gls{deep}.
  \item[Do the creatures down there just carry lights all the time?]
  Yes -- the book explains that all creatures have some source of light, or carry torches.
\end{description}

Every two questions will take an entire \gls{interval} to answer.
And if answers contradict each other, so be it.

Little by little, the troupe can create a complete image of how the \gls{deep} works, all of it fictional.
