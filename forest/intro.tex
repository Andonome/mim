Nobody thrives in the forest -- at best they survive.

Gource bushes, bogs, rivers, and suspicious noises make every step challenging.
As dusk falls, darkness traps people with the threat of getting lost.
Asking for an \roll{Intelligence}{Survival} roll at \gls{tn} 14 is not unreasonable.

During \gls{cFive}, the troupe can sleep without a fire.
But during normal weather, they will need a fire in order to get any real rest.
And of course, over \gls{cTwo}, a large fire becomes \emph{mandatory}, despite the usual dangers.%
