\section{Frayed Ends}

Once the \glspl{pc} exhaust all of the available \gls{sq} \glspl{segment} in a location, the area risks becoming plot-barren.
Look again at the \gls{sq} list on \vpageref{sqListForest} and you'll see what I mean.
To stop this happening, random \glspl{sq} which lead nowhere, and don't have a wider tale to tell, sit at the bottom of the pile, waiting to catch players when they have nothing else to threaten them, but without beginning yet another \gls{sq}.
