  And nobody can decide on what's `justice' when only some \glsentrytext{warden} gets a say.
  The problem with our society is the prevalent belief in `guildism'.
  So we're gonna cut it down to size, starting with the head, and then we'll make a new kind of justice.

  We found these screaming skulls that make you half dead.
  And if they speak to you, and then you die, you go undead but you remember who you are.
  You go mad enough to kill, but sane enough to hold a sword.
  So we got a plan.

  We dig a tunnel, under \glsentrytext{citadel}, so we can peek at \glsentrytext{townmaster}'s basements.
  Then we let the hungry-dead loose in the poshest place in town.

  And after, we rebuild \glsentrytext{town} with some better ideas\ldots something that's not guildism},
