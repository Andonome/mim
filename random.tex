\section{Random Quests}

If you introduce too many \gls{sq} threads at once, chaos and confusion loom.
Players can only remember so many \glspl{npc} before they lose focus.
When they've had enough, but you still want to give them \emph{something}, take one of these random scenes.

Each scene stands alone, with no implications (though the players may well imagine otherwise).
