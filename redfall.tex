\subsection{\glsentrytext{redfall}}
\label{redfallVillage}
\index{Redfall}

\Gls{redfall} lies safely away from the \gls{edge}, and lies close to its guardian keep where the villagers can run if serious trouble rises.
The people in the area create pottery from the rich clay deposits.

The recent hike in taxes has driven the now-hungry villagers to desperate means.%
\footnote{See page \pageref{desperatemeasures} for more on \glsfmttext{nurabaron}'s draconic taxes.}

\begin{boxtext}
  \Gls{redfall} seems peaceful, almost idyllic, as children play next to copse of trees without any fear of beasts waiting for them inside.
  A few women collect the red earth by the river so they can process it into their famous pottery later.
  Ahead, the keep stands three stories high.
\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{When the PCs enter,}
if they look like like might be officials or soldiers of any type, the villagers act natural at first, but arrange to surround the troupe at the bridge.

\begin{boxtext}

  As you step onto the bridge, you see a dozen men walking behind you with large bags covering their heads and another sack in their hands.
  In front, another ten with sacks gather as well.
  Ahead and behind, they pull the rocks out.

  ``No more taxes!'', they shout.

\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If the PCs try to reassure the villagers,}
have them roll Strength + Empathy (TN 9) to holler their message clearly to everyone present.

Failure indicates a nasty pelting, although the villagers don't intend to kill the anyone -- just drive them off.

\paragraph{If the PCs ask about the keep,}
the villagers complain bitterly, but have no idea that \gls{nurabaron} has become a monster.

\paragraph{If the troupe attempt to persuade the villagers to assault the keep,}
they can succeed with a Charisma + Tactics roll, TN 10
(the villagers feel more confident with a strong character leading them).
Of course the villagers also know that the fortress is armed with archers, and will only agree to enter if the troupe have a solid plan concerning the archers.

\paragraph{If the keep ever becomes surrounded by peasants,}
\gls{nurabaron} will run out to an archer's post with a massive bag of food doused in ogre-dust.
He will pour it down, shouting apologies about the lack of food, and any villagers who eat the food will begin to turn into ogres.
If the troupe aren't quick, they'll be in a keep surrounded by ogres.
There isn't enough food for everyone, so after some turn into ogres, they'll start to eat the others, and many will simply flee.
This will leave ten ogres who chase the villages, ten more who bang on the gates, and ten who decide to go round the back of the keep to look fruitlessly for alternative entrances.

\subsection{\Glsfmttext{redfall} Keep}

The keep contains a conspiracy: everyone in there knows that they harbour monsters, but they also know that those monsters can be cured, and that if they tell anyone, they'll lose their employment, and will either have to beg or join the \gls{guard}.

\mapentry[redTower]{Towers}

Each of the towers has two archers, ready to protect their patron, \gls{nurabaron}, as long as nobody gets too close.

\mapentry[redYard]{Courtyard}

This open courtyard makes archery an easy job.  Anyone outside can easily be picked off if they do not have adequate shielding.

\mapentry[redKitchen]{Kitchen}

The dwindling food supplies are kept here.  They build up to monstrous amounts, then get hurriedly eaten within a day or two.  Barrels of meats, stacks of bread, and multiple bottles of wine -- nothing lasts long.

\mapentry[redServants]{Servants' Quarters}

This place holds various cots, chests, and washing equipment.  At present only six members of staff remain -- two cooks, two butlers, one diplomat,\footnote{See page \pageref{thorn} for Thorn the diplomat.} and James the tax collector.

\mapentry[redToilet]{Toilet}

This spacious lavatory comes with a runoff to the river outside.
It also hosts arrow slits to fire at intruders on the river.
Small characters (with Strength of 0 or less) can fit through the gap from outside, if they are not wearing armour.

\mapentry[redSmolYard]{Small Courtyard}

This area holds a thin, thatched root, and plenty of space for games without getting wet.
It's used as a common area by the servants.

\morphhorse[\npc{\N\A}{Janus, the Demonic Horse}]

One of the horses here was accidentally hit by some of the ogre-dust which affected \gls{nurabaron} and his family.  It ate the others, but despite the men protesting, \gls{nurabaron} has insisted on keeping it alive and very well fed.

\mapentry[redChild]{Benjie's Room}

\Gls{nurabaron}'s youngest son Benjie is only a toddler.
He doesn't understand his condition, and has no self control.
This makes him dangerous, so the family have decided to lock him in this little room.
Characters on the river or anywhere near this room can hear intermittent banging, and infant-like gurgling.

\mapentry[redHall]{Great Hall}

\begin{boxtext}

  You open the door to a massive table full of opulent food, and more food stacked on top.  Layers of bloody bones poke out the side of three layers of filthy dishes, lining the bottom of the feast.  At the head of the table, sits \gls{nurabaron}, in a meat-stained dressing gown.

\end{boxtext}

A heavy wooden door guards the entrance well, and a gate sits in front of that.  Lifting the gate takes a Strength + Athletics roll, TN 10, but the locks on the door don't give much resistance; players can pick them with Intelligence + Larceny, TN 6.  The bars are slim enough that anyone with a Weight Rating of 5 or less can just about squeeze through.

The hallways contains a long, messy dining table, covered in scraps of bones from all manner of animal.  The side alcoves contain little beds for guards to sleep in.  Four guards are in the area at any one time.

The baron can usually be found dining here, shouting at guards about some imagined insult, or just terrifying people for the fun of it.  Thorn, his trusted advisor, is the only one who can calm him down when he gets into a rage.

\mapentry[redStorage]{Old Storage Shelves}

Here the servants rest.
The armoury was once staffed by men at arms, but now has nothing but ogre-powder and other magical items from \glsentrylong{sewerking}.
Anyone disturbing the contents of this room must make a Dexterity + Crafts check, TN 7, or risk toppling something and spilling the powder everywhere, which will affect the characters as per the Saurecanta sphere (see \textit{Fenestra}\iftoggle{aif}{\autopageref{saurecanta}}{});
specifically, they get +2 to Strength and Speed, but -4 to Intelligence and Charisma.

\mapentry[redFamily]{Hidden Family}

In the upper floor, \gls{nurabaron}'s wife Marjorie stays with three of her children -- two boys and a girl.
All are a little too dangerous to be trusted wandering alone, so only one is let out of their room at a time.

These two attack fiercely, but retreat if any bargains have been made after a single round.

The two brothers were never good at listening, and will attack with abandon, unless Marjorie is nearby to talk them down.
