\subsection{\Glsfmttext{lakeside}}
\label{lakeside}

\Gls{lakeside} began as \pgls{bothy} on cursed soil.
Plants here cannot thrive, and even the trees grow crooked and pale.
It has recently grown into \pgls{village}, and sustains itself with fishing, trade, and taxes.
Builder Cronblight of the \gls{guard} functions effectively as \pgls{warden} to the two-hundred souls who live here.%
\footnote{Most humans would consider this violation of guild separation outrageous, but the \gls{village}'s small size makes for extenuating circumstances.}

Tall stone walls reach 4 metres into the air, and each house has stone walls and slate rooves.
But its bridges are made of wood, and ready to burn at a moment's notice if either side of the \gls{village} falls to some enemy.

\Gls{lakeside} has an unusually large number of well-armed young soldiers, ready to fight for their little patch of the world at a moment's notice.

The river and lake here provides important trade to the surrounding areas, and has the only source of raw iron to the town, so if the \gls{village} ever perishes, the price of weapons will double.

\mapentry[lakeSquare]{Central Square}

The town's central square contains a statue of \gls{townmaster}'s father looking lordly.

\mapentry[lakeTemple]{Big \Glsfmttext{bothy}}

The \glspl{pc} can buy just about any weapon they can name here.

\begin{boxtable}[lYYYYr]
  \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Attack Bonus} & \textbf{Damage Bonus} & \textbf{\Glsfmtshort{ap} Cost} & \textbf{Weight} & \textbf{Cost} \\\hline

  \Dagger & \arabic{weaponBonus} & \arabic{damage} & \arabic{heft} & \arabic{weight} & 150~\glspl{cp} \\

  \quarterstaff & \arabic{weaponBonus} & \arabic{damage} & \arabic{heft} & \arabic{weight} & 3 \glspl{sp} \\

  \shortsword & \arabic{weaponBonus} & \arabic{damage} & \arabic{heft} & \arabic{weight} & 15~\glspl{sp} \\

  \spear & \arabic{weaponBonus} & \arabic{damage} & \arabic{heft} & \arabic{weight} & 12~\glspl{sp} \\

  \hline
\end{boxtable}

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} are looking to hire a soldier,}
they will find capable people here.

\mapentry[lakeDocks]{Docks}

Here, boats from \gls{southDale} enter, carrying dwarvish spirits.

\Gls{beardedalemaster} comes here to collect her barrels of dwarven spirit, and transports them to \gls{pig} in \gls{town} with the rest of the \glspl{wolfhead}.%
\footnote{See `\nameref{troubleAle}', \vpageref{troubleAle}, for more on the plot.}
They then journey together, with a cart, to \gls{traitor}'s house, where he can smuggle it into \gls{town}.
