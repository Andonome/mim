\section{Silent Gorge}

\noindent
Two rocky hills stand on either side of a deep gorge, leaving only enough room for a single wagon to go through.
If two trading caravans meet, one will have to back-track, which is not easy with horses, especially as the gorge goes on for almost a mile.

One solution is to shout before entering the gorge, but this brings the danger of monsters, which will most likely come from behind the wagon...or above.
Another solution is to send scouts ahead.
This works well, as long as enough archers remain in each group to protect everyone.

Traders enter here rarely, as few have enough archers to enter safely.
As a result, trade has dwindled in the local \gls{village} (which is also now known as 'Silent Gorge').
