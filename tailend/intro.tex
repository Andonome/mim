\section{Frayed Ends}

You can't cast foreshadows forever, or the \gls{campaign} will never resolve cleanly.
But if the \glspl{sq} just stop, then \pgls{region} becomes plot-barren, leaving the \glspl{pc} with nothing to do but wait for random encounters.

To keep the \glspl{region} fertile, these \glspl{sq} have small, unrelated \glspl{segment} which lead nowhere, or prompt the troupe to enter another \gls{region}.
They form soft plot-beds to cushion the end of \pgls{region}'s \glspl{sq}.
Look at the \gls{sq} list on \vpageref{sqListForest} and you'll see what I mean.
