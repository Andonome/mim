\chapter{Locations}

Start in \gls{town}, hand the players a blank sheet of paper as a map.
Tell them to mark down anything they want.

They might mark parts of \gls{town}, then expand into the wilderness later; or the entire town might be a little dot on a larger map.

Just keep informing them about how far the river and forest are (if visible), and let the map grow naturally.

As the group wander the world, it can be filled out, bit by bit.
Maps at this point often have East at the start, so people can organize first thing in the morning by looking towards the rising Sun, so stick that in, then just have a map organically around it.
