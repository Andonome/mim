\noindent
The \gls{guard}'s chief duty lies in maintaining \glspl{bothy}.
Traders and travellers need these \glspl{bothy} to stay somewhere overnight when the next \gls{village} lies too far away.

The \glspl{pc} will begin in the Cinderfilch \gls{bothy} (named after \pgls{warden}'s daughter, who was eaten by a woodspy).
The locals know it as being particularly antagonistic towards horses, which is a problem for any trader whose wagon does not double as a horse-stall, capable of withstanding the curiosity of a chitincrawler.
If the troupe happen to be here when that happens, they'll have to stay outside, with lit fires all around the \gls{bothy}, to make sure the horses stay safe (people value horses far more than \gls{guard} Fodder).

Here the \gls{jotter} will give them orders to start on various random missions.%
\exRef{judgement}{Judgement}{NGmissions}
These might be easy (accompany these traders), or more challenging (guard that \gls{village} for a week), but once they step onto the road, they should have a little freedom to engage with the various \glspl{sq} before long.
