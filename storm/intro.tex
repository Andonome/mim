Here comes the mayhem!
Another \gls{fiend} has arrived, and he wants to turn \gls{valley} into an undead army; and the army sweeps through the land like a house-fire in \gls{cFive}.
The authorities will not help much, as the \gls{templeOfBeasts} need to focus on  the \glspl{whiteBandits} (who decide to assassinate most of the \glspl{jotter}).
Hopefully the \glspl{pc} have dealth with the \gls{spiderqueen} by this point.
Hopefully they found the source of all the undead under \gls{town} before the citadel becomes empty, leaving a child in charge of \gls{valley}.

Pulling these \glspl{thread} together depends entirely on what kind of mess the \glspl{pc} have found themselves (and \gls{valley}) in.
The real conclusions rely on what the players manage to discover around the locations, starting in \autoref{forestChapter}, and ending \vpageref{noEnding}.

The assumed starting date is the year \thefenestraYear, \showCycle, day \thefenestraDay.
But by this point in the \gls{campaign}, the \glspl{segment} may appear at any time, possibly spread two \glspl{cycle} apart.
