\subsection{The Shadow Gate}

\mapentry[entranceCullis]{Rusted Portcullis}

The rope to life the portcullis has long ago vanished.
The slow movement of earth above has sealed the metal bars in place.
They have barely rusted, suggesting good quality steel.

\mapentry[shadowPot]{Sticky Pot}

This ceramic pot has a thick seal of ropes and wax, and will not open easily.
The ooze which inhabits the deeper water \vpageref{shadowJelly} occasionally comes out, and leaves acidic mucus all over the pot, presumably sensing the contents.

Inside, rests a tiny little ooze-creature, under a \textit{Preservation} spell, ensuring it will not age so long as it remains still.
The temple \glspl{server} placed it here `in case of emergency', with a vague plan to make the entrance extremely dangerous if anything large entered.

\mapentry[shadowJelly]{Lowly Ooze}

An acidic ooze sits down here, minding its own business.
Occasionally a woodspy or basilisk enters to look around or hibernate, and the ooze begins to eat it.
And sometimes that creature escapes, and sometimes it does not.

The ooze has existed here for a long time, and has grown very large.

\begin{exampletext}
  When the magical gateway shut, the local \gls{warden} tasked \pgls{doula} to resolve the situation.
  Like anyone in her position, she told an enchanting story about success, then delegated the task.

  Finding three people too young to know better, she arranged for some very fancy clothes, and declared them `Masters of the Riddle', and `Keepers of the Gate'.
  Then she sent them into an enchanted state, preserving their bodies, and setting their minds to focus, without failure, on the single task of solving the riddle which had vexed all of \gls{valley}.

  The first thought about how much he hated Maths.
  The second thought about visualizing the riddle as a series of rivers, each one representing a possible set of questions and answers.
  The third had already gone to sleep to dream of sex with his attractive neighbour.

  With everyone's attention focussed on the `Masters of the Riddle', the \gls{doula} went home, and died peacefully shortly after.

  The three rest in this hidden room to this day.
