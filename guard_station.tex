\mapentry[guardstation]{Guard Station}

The grounds are patrolled by a minimum of five \glspl{sunGuard} at any point.
\Gls{captain} has an obsession with guards constantly rotating around the premise.
As a result, they've hidden a stash of whiskey in the bushes at the back, and sometimes have `rounds', while they do the rounds.

The wooden buildings tacked into the outer wall have thin rooves which constantly bend and creak -- walking silently across them is impossible for anything with a total weight of 4 or more.
