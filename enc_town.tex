\sidequest{The Trouble with Ale}
\label{troubleAle}

\startcontents[sq]

\sqminitoc

\noindent
\Gls{beardedalemaster} has been sending for alcohol supplies from the Shale, watering down the dwarvish brew, and selling it as regular ale.
She has made a killing in profits, and almost pushed out the regular Ale Guild.
\iftoggle{aif}{%
  \footnote{This organization is also known as the `temple of Alass\"{e}' -- see page \pageref{guilds} for more on divine monopolies.}%
}{}%
takes dwarvish ale to \gls{town}, then waters it down, and makes an absolute killing in profits.
\Gls{alemaster} isn't happy with his profits being cut into, so the two sides sabotage each other and shenanigans ensue.

\Gls{alemaster}, dresses his men as Knights%
\footnote{The term ``Knight'', is used by townsfolk for anyone in armour.
Guilds who travel need a lot of protection, as the roads are dangerous, and they general count as `knights'.}
from the faraway Ale Guild of the Shale, and has them cause trouble in order to give his rivals a bad name all around \gls{town}.
In retaliation, \gls{beardedalemaster}, dignitary to the Shale Ale Guild, destroys much of the local ale stores.

When not getting into trouble, \Gls{beardedalemaster} walks with the Wolf Heads%
\footnote{See page \pageref{beardedalemaster} for more on them.}
and drinks in \gls{whitehorse}.

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{The Drunken Knight}% NAME
{A knight of the local Ale Guild starts fights while pretending to be from the Ale Guild of the Shale}% SUMMARY

This encounter can easily slip into the background -- the knight has no interest in annoying the PCs, especially if they look well-armed.

\begin{boxtext}

  A rank wind blows through \gls{town}.
  From the street ahead a drunken man in full plate armour falls against a wall, before getting back up and shouting at passers by that they're pathetic for drinking elvish nonsense, and need a proper dwarvish drink.

\end{boxtext}

\ldots except, he's not a knight.
He's a member of the local Ale Guild.
He's acting drunk and showing a symbol of the Shale in order to give the rival sellers a bad reputation.

Players may notice he's pretending to be drunk with a Wits + Medicine Group Roll, or notice that his coat of arms isn't painted onto his breastplate quite right with a Wits + Academics Roll.
Both have TN 10.

{\squash Ale Explosion}% NAME
{Barrels of Ale explode down the street}% SUMMARY

Play this encounter at the same time as the next on the list.

\begin{boxtext}

  Suddenly the house to your right explodes, and water rushes down the street, knocking aside stalls, women, two stray dogs, and sweeping the lot down the road.  It foams and froths like mad, and then you notice -- this isn't water, it's ale!

\end{boxtext}

The party can avoid being swept down the street by the storm with a Wits + Athletics roll, TN 8.

\textbf{Background:} The local Ale Guild found that the more ale is brewed in a batch, the cheaper it becomes.
They bought a few cheap houses around the city, and build massive barrels to house the ale in.
However, \gls{beardedalemaster} found where they're stored, and paid a few street-rat children to come in and mess the place up, pulling corks out of the barrels, and such.
Unfortunately, with just a little too much jostling and jumping on the barrels, the unstable equipment exploded.

\paragraph{If the PCs investigate,}
an Intelligence + Vigilance Team Roll, TN 10, will allow the characters to find the bodies of the children who started the problem, along with the fact that they were recently speaking with \gls{beardedalemaster}, who currently drinks in \gls{pig}.%

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{You Can't Drink Here}% NAME
{People jeer at envoys from the Shale Ale Guild and a fight breaks out}% SUMMARY

\begin{boxtext}

  A crowd is vomiting out of a pub, pushing six men out with them\ldots or rather three men and three dwarves, all heavily armed.
  The crowd shout for them to go back to the mountains and that they're not welcome in the area, but a dwarf, covered in metal from head to toe, and wearing the emblem of the Ale Guild from the Shale, lifts his metal visor and shouts back at them, listing a litany of laws concerning public houses and the rights of foreign Guild \gls{nomad}, with deafening volume.

  The crowd just jeer, making a large vein in the dwarf's head bulge while his face turns redder by the moment.

\end{boxtext}

A \gls{nomad} troupe of three men and three dwarves from the Shale are tired from a long day's walk, and need a rest and drink, but the townsfolk think of the Ale Guild from the Shale as nothing but troublemakers.

Laxen, the angry dwarvish head \gls{nomad}, has had enough of the bickering and feels tough in his full plate armour.
He has no idea that \gls{beardedalemaster} has been pulling stunts, such as destroying the stores of the local Ale Guild.

\paragraph{If the characters do nothing,}
the crowd at one point pelt Laxen with some old soup, and local ale.
He swings pokes at the jeering crowd with a weapon, and a fight breaks out instantly.
The group then flee the city, and all ale trade with the Shale stops.

\paragraph{If the characters try to de-escalate the problem,}
give them an appropriate roll.
They have time to try multiple tactics, from asking the crowd to calm down, to threatening to call the guard.
However, the crowd are very angry, so the default TN for the encounter is 10.

\dwarvensoldier[\NPC{\Dw\M}{\Glsentrytext{nomad} Laxen}{Double Braided Beard}{Strokes beard}{Experience}]

\humansoldier[\npc{\T[3]\Hu\E}{Joshua, Rachael and Rob}]

These two are heavy drinkers, and heavy fighters, but they will stop as soon as Captain Laxen gives the word.

\dwarventrader[\npc{\T[2]\Dw\M}{Mugin \& Thunin}]

\Gls{beardedalemaster} still drinks at \gls{pig}.  

\paragraph{Conclusion:} If the characters can track down \gls{beardedalemaster} and have her talk with \gls{alemaster} they might be able to make peace between the two groups.
In this case, crisis is averted, and the final part can be discarded.

\beardedalemaster

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{\N\squash Dry}% NAME
{Guild fights have caused all ale supplies to run out}% SUMMARY

If the party did not manage to avert total disaster in the previous encounter, play this encounter together with the next Side Quest.

\begin{boxtext}

  Later that day, you can find no rest in a tavern.  The first has run out of ale, and the second.  Asking around, people are saying they've all dried up, and now serve nothing but foul water.  The town are becoming agitated.

\end{boxtext}

For the next two encounters, all social rolls have a -2 penalty, as everyone around is feeling irritable.

Meanwhile, townsfolk are drinking more and more unpurified water, all of which has been tainted by the sickness of the nura who live in the sewers.  Raise the local nura rating by 1.

There is no possibility to repair this damage once it's done, and no option to repair the situation any time soon.

\sidequest{The Lizardite Amulet}\label{lizardite}
\index{Lizardite Amulet}
\stopcontents[Villages]

\startcontents[sq]

\sqminitoc

\noindent
\textbf{Background:}
\gls{townmaster} wanted to give the citadel's greatest treasure to the woodspy bandits, so they could summon whatever building equipment they needed, but if anyone found them using the item, his connection to them would become obvious.
Therefore, he requested that \gls{alchemist} send the item to \gls{college}, while \gls{traitor} arranged to have the woodspy bandits steal it en route by extortion.

However, \gls{captain} knew that such a famous item would never travel without word spreading, so he has arranged to have several fake items made, each of which will take a different route.

\paragraph{The lizardite amulet}
summons any item, and is exceptionally powerful as it has 30 MP in total.  It functions as per the third level conjuration sphere.  Unfortunately, it cannot be used unless the user first uses the activation word, and secondly, speaks in Gnomish.\footnote{The amulet was made by a gnomish alchemist, though the University don't like to talk about this fact.}

\magicitem{The Lizardite Amulet}{Conjuration 3}{Alchemy}{Continuous}{Sentient Artefact (Experience)}{5}{30}

The party begin by transporting a copy of the amulet, fighting the woodspy bandits, hearing rumours about the real one, and eventually find it in a random village.

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{The Shell Game}% NAME
{The characters must take a fake amulet to the \glsentrytext{guard} for safe passage out of the area}% SUMMARY
\label{shellGame}

\Gls{captain}, has arranged for three replicas to be created, and hands them off to the \gls{guard} soldiers one at a time.
He pulls the PCs into his office (see page \pageref{guardstation}), and tells them the score.

\begin{speechtext}

  With so many of our best guardsmen investigating rumours of bandits around the \glsentrytext{edge}, I am forced to entrust you with the safe keeping of the Lizardite Amulet, at least until you can transport it to the regiment which sits at the crossroads.

  Take the amulet, and this note to them.

\end{speechtext}

\Gls{traitor} has no idea about \gls{captain}'s trickery, so he has arranged for the woodspy bandits to come in large numbers to the crossroads.

\paragraph{The \gls{guard} at the crossroads}
are a semi-permanent camp who look for trouble around the safe villages.
Some are soldiers, and many are scouts.
They have no idea that they are meant to take the amulet.

\humansoldier[\npc{\T[5]\Hu\E}{Five members of the \glsentrytext{guard}}]

\humansoldier[\npc{\T[10]\Hu\E}{Ten of the Woodspy Bandits}]

\woodspyleader

\Gls{woodspyleader} is a massive man, unable to run well, but he rarely needs to.

Each of the bandits rides a war horse (these are the only horses the bandits have).

\paragraph{If the PCs try to understand the item,}
have them roll Intelligence + Academics, TN 10.
Success means they understand the forgery.%
%! Understanding items ref required.

\paragraph{Once the PCs reach the crossroads,}
they can see the simple \gls{guard} camp in the distance, and hear the woodspy bandits coming behind them.

\paragraph{If the PCs aren't wearing \gls{guard} uniforms, do not carry visible weapons, and simply stroll along quietly,}
the bandits pass them politely, and attack the \gls{guard} camp.

\paragraph{If the bandits get the item,} they will retreat to \gls{greentower}.%
\footnote{See page \pageref{green_tower} for more on the Green Tower.}
They have no interest in bloodshed for its own sake.

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{The Book of War}% NAME
{\Glsentrytext{sewerking} hires a local thief to steal a book to learn of the amulet's command word}% SUMMARY

\textbf{Background:}
\Gls{sewerking}'s men have taken the Lizardite Amulet, but they cannot use it, so he has \gls{sewerthief} steal the \textit{Book of Ancient Wars}, detailing various battles about the time of time of Rex Dalius.%
\iftoggle{aif}{
  \footnote{See Fenestra, page \pageref{h_dalius} for more.}
}{}%
The book comes from the restricted works in the Temple of C\'{a}l\"{e} (i.e. the local library).
Among the various things the book talks about, it mentions the alchemical amulet which conjures things, and describes the word which allows the user to activate its powers.
This won't be obvious as the book is very long, and very tedious.

What \emph{is} obvious, is the sprinting thief.

\begin{boxtext}

  A man sprints towards you at lightning speed, carrying a book, then darts to the side and down the street.

\end{boxtext}

Players who say they want to stop him before he rushes past should make a Wits + Empathy check at TN 9 (to quickly understand his nefarious intent).
As soon as he's gone, three of \gls{town} \gls{guard} bound round the corner in pursuit, shouting at the characters to get him.

The thief attempts to run to \gls{pig}, then disappear past the lively crowd, and into the private room.%
\footnote{See page \pageref{pigPrivate}.}

\sewerthief

\paragraph{If the Lizardite Amulet is definitely elsewhere,}
it doesn't matter, because \gls{sewerking} does not know that yet.
He thinks his men still have it, or plans to get it back.

\paragraph{If the PCs catch up,}
\gls{pigowner} will stop \gls{sewerthief} entering the hatch to the secret labyrinth below, so the immortal bandits will not be discovered.

The thief will have to pay a library fine of 3 cp (unless the PCs push for a harsher penalty).

\paragraph{If the PCs try to understand the importance of the book,}
they can make an Intelligence + Academics roll, TN 12.

\sqpart{Villages}% AREA
{\squash Rumours of Magic}% NAME
{Local villagers think they have figured out the command word for the amulet}% SUMMARY

Whether or not the book survived, one way or another, the item's magical activation word has been discovered\ldots or so the villagers think.
Specifically, they think the command word ``Saur\"{e}'' will activate the item.
Everyone's talking about what they would do if they found the ``magical wishing amulet''.
Most people don't understand its powers, and think they can just wish to be the Rex, or to be young.

An Intelligence + Academics Group Roll at TN 7 lets the party know that this is nonsense.%
\iftoggle{core}%
{\footnote{See the core rules, page \pageref{grouproll}, for Group Rolls.}}%
{}

Play the next Side Quest from the Villages immediately.

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{The Mob}% NAME
{A fake amulet is dropped, and the townsfolk all clamour after it}% SUMMARY

\begin{boxtext}

  A trumpet at the city gate sounds off, and the \gls{guard} can be seen standing upon the great town wall, with three bleeding criminals kneeling at their sides, and three severed heads in their hands.
The town crier shouts out.

\end{boxtext}

The item resurfaces in town, as a guard drops it, and all the townsfolk are ready to trample each other to death for it.

\begin{boxtext}
  \begin{quotation}
    Hear ye, all!

    Our brave, and skilful warriors of the \gls{guard} have gone out to the depths of the forest, and pulled out some of the local bandits who have so terrorized the poor men and women in these lands, with theft and murder.

    They have lost one of their number, and we mourn the loss of \ldots how the hell do I say this?

    We mourn the loss of `Stanisele', who died fighting for \gls{king}.

    But we also celebrate, as the famous lizardite amulet, property of \gls{college}, was rested from the hands of the bandits.

  \end{quotation}

  One of the night guard holds the amulet aloft in great, gloved hands, but then fumbles, and slips.  The amulet falls many yards smoothly to the ground.  The crowd hear the tiniest `clink', and then a young girl runs forward, shouting that she wants to wish for shoes.  The crowd begin to move, \emph{fast}.

\end{boxtext}

Getting through the crowd requires a Strength + Empathy roll, TN 10.
Town guards nearby also want to use the item, so they pull out their swords and prepare to cut down anyone stealing ``\glsentrytext{king}'s property''.
If the players don't intervene, the scene turns into a bloodbath within a couple of rounds.

Once finally obtained, an Intelligence + Academics Group Roll at TN 10 shows that this is not the real amulet.

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{They Took Our Jobs!}% NAME
{Novice cutthroats assault the characters, but they have no idea what they're doing.}% SUMMARY

Pick a character who's most likely to go somewhere alone.  If that's not feasible, the party are ambushed when sleeping in a tavern.
However it goes down, they're being robbed by some wannabe-thieves.

\begin{speechtext}

  Don't try any funny business.  Just hand over the gold. Or silver.  Or at least definitely those boots -- god I'd kill for proper boots.  I mean, I actually will.  I'll kill you.  Hand them over.

\end{speechtext}

A quick Wits + Empathy check, TN 8, reveals the thieves haven't a clue what they're doing.
Once the non-fight has ended, the characters might ask what these three think they were doing.
They reply that they once worked for a Villagemaster, but Clarisa was accused of stealing tax money.
Robert was set to guard the money after the next round of tax collection, but in the morning, it was all gone.
The next week, all the staff were fired, as their replacements had arrived.

They claim that they never stole a penny, and have no idea how the money vanished.

The truth of the matter is that the taxes in the local village were being paid with false coin.
One woman, using the Lizardite Amulet, summoned false coinage, which disappeared soon after.

{The Old Lady}% NAME
{An old lady has found the amulet, and used it to hand out magical jewellery to local serfs}% SUMMARY

\begin{boxtext}
  A grubby little girl dances down the road with bear feet, occasionally singing, then stopping.

    ``Do you like my jewels?'', she asks.

  She has one massive green rock of immense value, hanging from a copper chain, and four bracelets on each arm, each studded with crystals.
\end{boxtext}

The actual Lizardite Amulet left with scouts of the \gls{guard}, a day after the players.
Chitincrawlers caught and ate the guards, and the leftovers were rummaged through by Martha, a middle-aged villager.
After a visit from a gnomish alchemist, she learned the item's command word, and a few gnomish words for things to summon.\footnote
{\textit{Gold coins, ledge, boots, gold-necklace, dry sticks, satchel, fancy bracelet, pestle, morter, horseshoe, bandage, water, frying pan, coat, hat} and \textit{bowl.}}

Today, she summoned jewels to entertain Emily, a little girl.
Emily wants to keep the source of her jewels a secret, and the characters have zero chance of bribing her.
After a day, the jewels vanish into thin air.

{\squash Martha Returns}% NAME
{The old woman who has the item helps the characters}% SUMMARY

If the characters left Martha to continue her good work in the villages with the magical item then there's one more part.
Combine this with the next Side Quest's encounter, and if the characters get into trouble, Martha comes to their aid, along with her sons, Harry and Oscar.
If not, leave this encounter till the next time the characters are in trouble in the villages.

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{\N \squash Rumours of Glory}% NAME
{The party hear about famous warriors in their area}% SUMMARY

The local gossip relates to how the local heroes, known as the \textit{Wolf Heads}, recently protected a town from a goblin invasion.
They act like the adventurers of old, but officially take their orders from the Ale Guild of the Shale, through \gls{beardedalemaster}.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item{There were around forty goblins.}
  \item{The Wolf Heads stopped them with grease spells over the walls, so the goblins could not climb properly, leaving the archers time to pick off more.}
  \item{The local village master refused to pay for goblin heads taken, claiming it would be illegal as it would count as him raising his own army.}
  \item{The party refused to gather payment from the local peasants, but have sworn a blood oath to kill Village Master Solus.}
\end{enumerate}

This last rumour isn't entirely accurate -- the Wolf Heads are irritated with Village Master Solus (see page \pageref{solus}), but have not sworn an oath to kill him.

Play this encounter at the same time as the next Side Quest part, and raise the local nura rating by 1.

\sqpart{Villages}% AREA
{Arm Wrestling}% NAME
{The characters meet the Wolf Heads}% SUMMARY
\label{wolfHeads}

The Wolf Heads have just encountered ten chitincrawlers, and slew the lot.
They used a giant web spell, along with a lot of arrows.

They are tired, but unwounded, and are up for fun, so they went to a nearby village to drink.
Wherever the characters are, they encounter the Wolf Heads, who then challenge them to arm-wrestling contests, or magical contests.
The Wolf Heads will also speak about encountering goblins, both during the recent assault on a village, and in general.
The games are mostly in good faith, but if the party have any obviously valuable items, Jubilee will attempt to steal it from them.

\sqpart{Villages}% AREA
{A Cry for Help}% NAME
{The party find the Wolf Heads attacked by ogres}% SUMMARY

A dozen ogres ambushed the Wolf Heads on the road, and the party heard their cries in the distance.
By the time the party arrive (assuming they come towards the cries) Bertold is unconscious (-3 HP), and Jubilee is nearly dead (2 HP left).

Ten ogres remain alive.
Five are focussed on the remaining Wolf Heads, and the other five have decided to wait in the bushes to ambush the party (or if not the bushes, inside nearby houses, or anywhere appropriate).

\paragraph{\N If the party leave}
then the Wolf Heads die (raise the local Nura rating by 1 as the Wolf Heads can no longer help).
If the Wolf Heads survive, they will rest in \gls{town}, and be ready for any call to adventure, such as joining the fight against the nura in the future.

\paragraph{If the party rescue the Wolf Heads,}
then the Wolf Heads can tell them about \gls{banditking}'s plan to create a blight, cutting the Grey Valley off from the rest of the kingdom.%
\footnote{See \autopageref{blightConspiracy}.}
They overheard the plan while stalking the Immortal Bandits.

Havoc broke out, and \gls{pig} is closed until further notice.
\footnote{See page \pageref{pig_pantry} for details on what happened.}

As a result, all the alcoholics who have been chucked out of every area in the city are out in full swing.
The rest of the night is full of random people brawling.

\begin{boxtext}

A drunken man with uncomprehending eyes stares at you, then shouts.

\begin{quotation}

  Oi! Pointy-eared freak.  The freakshow left last week.  They decide to leave you behind?

\end{quotation}

\end{boxtext}

Trev's not happy, and he's taking it out on the group.
Pete doesn't know the group, but he's decided he's going to speak up for them and kick the crap out of Trev.
However the PCs react, a fight will break out around them.
Once the fight's ended, the characters might think they're out of harm's way, but the streets are rampant with trouble.

\humanfarmer[\npc{\T[4]\Hu}{Irate Alcoholics}]

The Whiteplains thieves in the sewers have a real fight on their hands, as the ghast freed some of the less intelligent undead, and they don't have enough rings to remain safe from the undead.

\paragraph{If the characters approach \gls{pig},}
give them a Wits + Vigilance check  to notice the distant sounds of a fight (TN 10 to notice, TN 12 to figure out the sounds come from below the Private Room).

\paragraph{If the PCs come to the rescue,}
\gls{pigowner} and the rest immediately lie about the situation:

\begin{speechtext}
  We always used the start of that tunnel to flush away waste underground, and now we find the dead are coming up!

  The underbelly of \gls{town} has been flooded for as long as anyone can remember, so perhaps something nasty lurks down there.

  I'm going to barricade the tunnel, then the door!
  I won't have this happening again, I can tell you!
\end{speechtext}

\paragraph{If the PCs venture down the tunnel,}
\gls{pigowner} invites them, but conspires to have some of the Immortal Bandits ambush them.

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{\N\N Unexpected Ghouls}% NAME
{Hobgoblin ghouls from below emerge and attack the town}% SUMMARY

Twenty of the undead from the sewer have escaped through the butcher's place%
\footnote{See area 5 on \gls{town}'s map.}
because the bandits who live down there were simply not careful enough.
If the characters confront the dead head-on, they will have a bad time, six of the town guard are only a few streets away.

\begin{boxtext}

  Screams erupt next door.
  Feet move quickly, and you see three men being pulled to the ground by a silent mob of massive, naked men.
  The mob pulls the men inside but makes no sound, and then the screaming stops.

  Another steps closer, and you can see these men and women have died and rotted some time ago.
  Their white eyes look at you with intense interest, then start to walk towards you.

  In the far distance, the town guard can be heard shouting to keep the noise down.

\end{boxtext}

Any character can summon the nearby guard with a Strength + Empathy roll, TN 7, to shout out loud.
The guards take 5 rounds to arrive, but every Margin on the roll reduces that time by 1 round, to a minimum of 2 rounds.

\ghoul[\npc{\T[20]\D}{20 Ghouls}]

\paragraph{At the end of the day,}
the ghouls will be put to the sword one way or another, but the question remains; what brought them here?

\paragraph{If the party track the ghouls,}
they won't find the city streets help much, and the bandits in the sewers will start to clear up the butchers as soon as the horde have gone.
The roll is Wits + Vigilance (TN 14).

Increase the local nura rating by 1.

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{\N Underground Assassins}% NAME
{The bandits in the sewer cut \Glsentrytext{captain}'s throat}% SUMMARY

\textbf{Background:}
\Gls{captain} has been pushing the investigation into the undead and nura sightings in town, so \gls{sewerking} ordered a hit on him, lead by \gls{sewerthief}.
Five men walked casually about him as he returned home \gls{whitehorse} with his wife, then closed in so one could stab him in the neck.

\begin{boxtext}

  You hear guards shouting ``After them!'', in the distance, and quickly scurrying feet, as a woman shouts for someone to help her wounded husband.

\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If the characters stay to help the wounded man,}
they find \gls{captain} with a knife-wound, next to his wife.
The roll is Wits + Medicine, at TN 9 to save his life.

\paragraph{If they run after the thieves,}
the PCs make a Group Roll of Speed + Athletics.%
\iftoggle{core}%
  {\footnote{See the core rules, page \pageref{grouproll}, for Group Rolls.}}%
{}%
Remember that whoever's trying to patch up \gls{captain}'s bleeding neck won't be able to join the chase.

\begin{tcolorbox}[tabularx={cX},top=10pt,bottom=10pt]

  Roll & Result \\\hline
  12 & \textit{``Giving chase, you catch up to four men running from the scene of the crime.''} \\
  11 & \textit{``You run round an alley, and find a drain cover clanking. The assassins have jumped underground.''} \\
  9 & \textit{``You run in hot pursuit, but the attackers have disappeared down a street, into thin air.''} \\
  7 & \textit{``The attackers sprint away, leaving you running in the dark.''} \\

\end{tcolorbox}

\sewerthief

\humanthief[\npc{\T[4]\E\Hu}{Four of the Sewer Thieves}]

\paragraph{If the party follow the assassins underground,}
they run to the nearest entrance -- perhaps the butchers or \gls{pig}.
Go to page \pageref{sewers}.
Otherwise, this incident will remain a mystery.

If \gls{captain} survives, he has little idea of what's happening, although a little investigation could reveal what he's been asking about recently (Intelligence + Vigilance Teamwork Roll, TN 10).
Raise the local Nura Rating by 1.

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{\N\N\squash Rise of the Immortal Bandits}% NAME
{\Glsfmttext{sewerking} releases ghouls upon the citadel}% SUMMARY

\textbf{Background:}
\Gls{sewerking} undead have finally finished digging the tunnel
\footnote{See page \pageref{citadelTunnel} for the underground tunnel.}
underneath \gls{town}'s citadel,
\footnote{See page \pageref{citadel} for the town's Citadel.}
where \gls{townmaster} lives.
He releases the undead, and guides them upstairs, through the dark halls.
As the \gls{guard} torches cast light on undead faces, each one makes a decision to stay and do their duty, or flee and live.

By this point, the undead horde numbers over a hundred, and the citadel has not prepared for anything like this.
It has perhaps twenty guards, and most of them work there because they seemed loyal, rather than capable.

\Gls{sewerking} leads his horde to the palace's main door with two ghasts to stop anyone exiting, and leaves the horde to slowly work its way up the stairs and rooms, killing anyone they come across.

Play the next available encounter first, then interrupt it with news of the citadel's attack.
Everyone can hear the screams from half-way across \gls{town}.

\paragraph{If the PCs intervene,}
they find \gls{sewerking} at the door, with much of his mana depleted already from fights with the guard.
He will flee to the sewers the moment he feels unsafe.

\ghast

\ghast

\sewerking

\humansoldier[\npc{\T[6]\E\Hu}{Palace Guard}]

\paragraph{If the PCs pursue \gls{sewerking},}
he already has a cave-in prepared to block his escape, so he waits -- holding a piece of rope, tied around a beam.
As the PCs round the corner, they can roll Wits + Crafts (TN 10) to notice the trap and retreat.
If they fail (or run through the trap anyway), they can roll Speed + Athletics (TN 10) to make it through anyway.

If both rolls fail, the roof collapses, inflicting 8 Damage, and 8 Fatigue Points.
Digging someone out from under the rubble requires an Intelligence + Crafts roll (TN 12), and they don't have long before the person under the rubble dies from asphyxiation (no resting actions allowed).

\paragraph{If the PCs want to run up the stairs and save \gls{townmaster},}
they have 8 rounds before the ghouls devour him, and will need to travel across 20 squares before reaching \gls{townmaster}'s room on the second floor.

\paragraph{If \gls{townmaster} dies,}
then his sons most likely die with him.
Leadership of \gls{town} `temporarily' goes to \Gls{captain} (or \gls{traitor} if \gls{captain} already died).

{Pickpocketed}% NAME
{Someone has stolen one of the characters' items}% SUMMARY

\begin{boxtext}

  You feel the side of your leg and suddenly your heart stops.
  You wonder where is\ldots \textit{which item is the last one written on your character sheet?}

\end{boxtext}

The player with the highest Intelligence Bonus makes a Wits + Vigilance roll, TN 9.
Failure indicates a thief has stolen the last item on the player's character sheet, and successfully fled.

It might be possible to track the thief, down with enough time spent investigating, but it'll require an Intelligence + Vigilance roll at TN 11.

Gary, local pickpocket, has no excuse except for his young age, and bad luck in life, though he's 25 and was recently kicked out of an apprenticeship for drinking too heavily on the job.

If the players turn him in, he will be pulled up about previous crimes at the same time, and hanged by the end of the week.
With the right deal, he might agree to accompany them on a dangerous mission.

{The Riddle}% NAME
{\Glsentrytext{college} have raised a bounty on a riddle}% SUMMARY

The townsfolk are abuzz with a riddle.
The mage's guild have become tired of only getting students sent by rich parents with no real ability.
They've raised a bounty of 5gp to anyone who can solve the riddle.
Their hope is that the most talented young men of the realm will come forward, and once they do, a long talk proceeds, as the mages tell whoever gets the correct answer why they should join \gls{alchemists}.

\begin{boxtext}
Three gods stand in front of you.  One always says the truth, one always lies, and one speaks randomly.  They refuse to speak your language, but they understand what you are saying.  You have three questions to identify each god.
\end{boxtext}

To answer the riddle correctly, the characters must pose three questions which guarantee they will correctly identify each god -- guessing is not allowed.
\footnote{This question is mostly here for fun.  Most players will have zero chance of answering this riddle.
It's placed here solely as a conversation piece, but be aware that this is technically possible, and the party may soon be very rich.}

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{\squash The Captain}% NAME
{\Glsentrytext{captain} jumps into another encounter to help the party}% SUMMARY

\Gls{captain} is heading home after a long night (if this is the afternoon, it's been a \emph{very} long night).
Combine this encounter with the next Side Quest part.
If the party are in trouble, he helps.
If they're known thieves, he tries to follow them, then brings guards.

\captain

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{Illegal Songs}% NAME
{A bard is caught singing about how much better it was before the current ruler, \Glsentrytext{king}}% SUMMARY

\begin{boxtext}
  A little crowd have gathered in the side street, occasionally clapping their hands to a beat.
  Getting closer, you can hear a mandolin and a soft voice, singing of great heroes fighting back nura hordes coming up from the depth.
\end{boxtext}

The singer is \gls{warningbard}, and he's here to sing the praises of any nobles who might pull together an army to push back the nura, like nobles did in the old days.
However, such an army would be illegal, as only \gls{king} can gather armies, or amass large amounts of weaponry, and so far the area does not have enough of the \gls{guard} to defend itself from rising levels of nura.

\begin{boxtext}

  Moving slowly through the crowd, you spy \gls{captain}.

\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If the characters are members of the \gls{guard},}
\gls{captain} will reprimand them for not arresting \gls{warningbard}.
They will be sent to watch over the station's dungeon (page \pageref{stationDungeon}), then sent on some dangerous mission at the \gls{edge}.

Either way, \gls{captain} will arrest \gls{warningbard}.

\paragraph{For the rest of the day,}
all of \gls{town} is full of talk about how in the old days, the nura were not a threat, because adventurers would always come to save them, or individual town masters could pull together the armies they needed to quell nura uprisings.

\paragraph{If the party do not intervene,}
\gls{warningbard} will end up in the cells for six months.
\footnote{For the cells under the \glsentrytext{guard} station, see page \pageref{guardstation}.}

\warningbard

\paragraph{If the party spend any length of time speaking with \gls{warningbard},}
he mentions that he knows \gls{forestpriest}.
He also happens to know where \gls{forestpriest}'s stays in the forest, but will not reveal that information unless he trusts the PCs.
\footnote{See page \pageref{lostcity} for the location.}

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{Pickpocketed Again!}% NAME
{Someone else picks a character's pocket}% SUMMARY

The player with the highest Academics Skill rolls Wits + Vigilance, TN 8.

\begin{boxtext}

  You feel your trouser leg, and suddenly think ``Oh, not again!''.  \textit{What's the last item written on your character sheet?}

\end{boxtext}

This time it's a young woman, down on her luck as her family farm was consumed entirely by nura.
The rest have died, and she's now alone.

\paragraph{If caught,}
Judith apologizes profusely, and explains her situation.
