\sidequest[Town,Roads]{Entitlement}

\noindent
The \gls{whiteBandits} are a bandit ring with a difference.
Their magic rings make them semi-undead, and they sometimes use undead horses, which cannot gallop, but never tire, so they can raid for many miles around their haven.%
\footnote{See page \pageref{necromancers_lair} for more on their foetid living conditions.}

\begin{boxtext}
  In the far distance, a trading caravan approaches.
  You can see the head rider's long hair trailing behind him in the \showTemperature\ wind.
  Both coaches have the usual archer on the top, though they don't look like \glspl{guard}.

%! Traitor contracts disease from outside necro temple

{\Glsentrytext{sewerking} introduces himself as a fence}% SUMMARY

\begin{exampletext}
  A month ago, \pgls{guard} Rider reported finding a ruined temple to \gls{traitor}.%
  \footnote{See \vpageref{necromancers_lair}.}
  \Gls{traitor} went with \gls{sewerking} to investigate it, and they found some old, sacred, and valuable, statues, and \pgls{artefact}.%
  \footnote{See \vpageref{The Bladder Skull}.}
  They also received an arrow wound from \gls{necromancer}, the \gls{artefact}'s undead creator.

  \Gls{sewerking} has decided to take it upon himself to deliver them to \gls{lakeside} by road, so he can avoid the heavy taxes levied in \gls{town}.%
  \Gls{lakeside} always has someone willing to buy valuable items, without too many questions.%
  \footnote{See \vpageref{lakeside}.}
\end{exampletext}

\setcounter{wounds}{2}

\sewerking

\humanarcher[\npc{\T[6]\Hu}{\arabic{noAppearing} \glspl{whiteBandits}}]

\Gls{sewerking} greets the troupe in a friendly way, and explains he's going to \gls{lakeside} to sell his wares for a `client'.
He refuses to divulge any information about this client, then begins hinting that if the troupe ever run into anything valuable, and need to sell it, he can be very discrete.

\begin{speechtext}
  If you brave warriors ever need to sell any `paintings' you find, you can always find me in \gls{whitehorse}, in \gls{town}.
  Just ask for me, and they'll show you right in.%
  \footnote{This is simply not true -- he keeps a very low profile.}

  Anyway, it's a dangerous road.
  Fancy turning the other way and joining me?
  You know, all the work you do in the \gls{guard} has real value.
  People don't tell you that enough, but you guys save everyone, every day, and nobody says `thank you'.
  Why don't you come and protect people on this road, instead of that one, and I'll say `thank you', at the end.
\end{speechtext}

\Gls{sewerking} then offers the troupe 1~\glspl{sp} per mile, in total, if they join him till \gls{lakeside}.
He will only travel by road, so he can avoid \gls{townmaster}'s taxes.

The length of the journey depends on how far this scene takes place from \gls{lakeside}.
\Gls{sewerking} takes a route not too far, or close to town,
\iftoggle{judgement}%
  {so the Civilization Rating should be about 7 to 10, most of the time.%
  \footnote{See \textit{Judgement}, \autopageref{civilizationRating}.}}{so encounters shoud consist of traders more than monsters.}

\paragraph{If anyone asks about the archers,}
\gls{sewerking} explains jovially.

\begin{speechtext}
  We come from the Temple of `Odd-Job', to save people from the god of messing-about and time-wasting!%
  \footnote{The characters will understand that this is a joke.}
\end{speechtext}

\paragraph{If the party press the issue,}
\gls{sewerking} explains that he comes from \gls{whiteplains}, and while his family were \glspl{warden}, they have become poor, due to the high taxes imposed by \gls{town}, so now he travels and takes work where he can, and hires people to help him.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} abandon their mission,}
the next time they see \pgls{jotter}, the leader will have some explaining to do.
They should roll \roll{Intelligence}{Deceit} (\tn[12]), or suffer a demotion.
Fodder who behave in this way (the lowest rank) will find themselves escorted to the \gls{court} in \gls{town}, where \gls{townmaster} (or some other \gls{warden}) will sentence them.%
\exRef{judgement}{Judgement}{pitOfJustice}

\paragraph{The wagons hold,}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  20 days' rations.
  \item
  2 ancient human skulls, with red stones inserted around the edges, forming a crown.
  \item
  A stone statue of a half-dead man in repose, in a coffin.
\end{itemize}

{The Deal}% NAME
{The \glsentrytext{whiteBandits} request help}% SUMMARY

The \gls{whiteBandits} have gotten in a fight with the \gls{guard}, and both sides have left in a bad state.
They don't like the idea of two bandit rings in the area, so they plan to follow the \gls{whiteBandits} quietly, and kill them in their sleep.

\begin{boxtext}

  As you top the next hill, a group of six men wheel round and ready their bows at you, before their commander calms them.

\end{boxtext}

\Gls{sewerking} has noted he's being followed, so when he sees the party, he acts friendly, pretends to be a member of the Weapons Guild from \Gls{whiteplains}, and hopes they can travel together until the danger has passed.
He explains the situation while telling them not to look behind (``the bandits might notice you've spotted them!''), and asks for their help in formulating a plan.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} ask more about his background,}
he tells them his current business is top-secret.

\sewerking

\humansoldier[\npc{\T[12]\Hu}{12 Woodspy Bandits}]

\paragraph{If the party agree to accompany the \gls{whiteBandits},}
then \gls{sewerking} stays with them for a day, but makes sure they do not follow him all the way to their secret home, and avoids town at all cost in case someone recognizes one of his men.

\paragraph{If the party push for a fight,}
they will have one.

{Dead Nobles}% NAME
{\Glsfmtplural{warden}' bodies float down a river}% SUMMARY

\Gls{sewerking} has pulled up a supply of diseased mushroom, and \gls{banditking} has poisoned an entire \gls{warden} family, before laying waste to the entire family, including servants.


\sqpart{Roads}% AREA

{When every \glsfmtplural{jotter} lies dead, the troupe discover freedom}% SUMMARY

The \gls{whiteBandits} have finally pulled off their plan to have every \gls{jotter} in \gls{valley} killed in a single night.
The troupe find one such \gls{bothy}, with a short clue as to the culprit.

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{Bandits Caught}% NAME
{The bandits who plagued the countryside have been imprisoned}% SUMMARY

\textbf{Background:}
The \glspl{pc} have captured \gls{banditking} alive.

\begin{boxtext}

  Hear, ye!  Hear all!

  Bandits who roamed the highways, lead by a man known as \gls{banditking}, have been apprehended.  The leader shall be drawn and quartered by week's end, and his companions hanged that night.

  Bakers are henceforth forbidden from purchasing the flour of the Quennome region, and any found doing so will be charged with consorting with elves.

  The temple of Alass\"e invites any charismatic men or women to aid the festivities, as playwrites and attractive actors are required for the upcoming festivities (not you, Margaret!).

\end{boxtext}

\Gls{banditking} will not be killed by law enforcement.
Those in \gls{pig} will inform \gls{sewerking} long before, and the rescue will commence as the bandits in the sewer storm the guards' holding.
Meanwhile, if \gls{necromancer}'s lair survives, the other bandits await instructions there.

\humansoldier[\npc{\T[10]\Hu}{10 Bandits}]

The only way for the characters to secure \gls{banditking}'s demise it to watch the guards' station all night.
If they do so, ten bandits stage an attack during the night.

\paragraph{The Distraction} starts by using ogre dust in three places in town to distract the local guards.

The attack begins once there are only ten guards left in the station.
\Glsentrytext{sewerking}'s men arrive, ready to break everyone out underground and take off into the nearest entrance to the sewer.
