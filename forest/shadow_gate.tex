\histEvent{350}{5}{The Vore Gate opens in \glsentrytext{sixshadow}}

\begin{exampletext}
  \noindent
  \Gls{sixshadow} began as an unremarkable settlement, but with a research outpost for alchemists.
  The small \glspl{village} sustained the alchemists' tower, and the tower let them keep all the dangerous things far away, and over the \gls{sixshadow} mountains.

  Dangerous \glspl{artefact} stayed underground, in `\gls{shadowVault}', and dangerous alchemists stayed in the tower, away from any large populations.

  The greatest and maddest of the alchemists at the time created a long-range spell to detect powerful mana flows, deep underground, and then created a gateway -- a tear in space -- which allowed him to step through, and explore the tunnels of the \gls{deep}, in order to find powerful \glspl{ingredient}.
  Unfortunately, the gateway opened to nothing but dark, rocky, tunnels, and those who explored a little way in never returned.

  As a by-product of the spell, the gateway itself became sentient (meaning it was \pgls{artefact}).
  And like most \glspl{artefact}, it became obsessed with the one task which the alchemist created it to do -- to have people enter through it.
  So the \gls{artefact} gateway would open again, whenever it had the energy, in the hopes of tempting someone inside.
  The alchemists named it, `the Vore Gate'.
\end{exampletext}

\paragraph{If the troupe remain for a long time,}
any \glspl{witch} will find it difficult to regain \pgls{mp} at the end of \pgls{interval}, because that one \gls{mp} goes to whoever has the biggest vacuum.
Once the \glspl{artefact} cast a few spells, everyone who wants \pgls{mp} finds themself in competition with everyone (and everything) else.

\subsection[Downstairs]{\glsentrysymbol{yonder}\quad Downstairs\quad\glsentrysymbol{abderian}}

The air smells of dampness and coagulated mana.
In the darkness, the characters may year \gls{yonder}'s bell ring below.

\mapentry[shadowStairs]{Muddy Steps}

Traversing the staircase demands a \roll{Dexterity}{Caving} roll at \tn[6] (or \tn[8] over \gls{cTwo}, when it freezes).
Failure inflicts $1D3$ Damage.

\mapentry[entranceCullis]{Gnome-Crafted Fence}

\begin{boxtext}
  The metal fence looks black in the darkness, but once \pgls{torch} approaches it has a subtle, blue, gleam.%
  \footnote{Some centuries ago, six gnomes emerged from the Vore Gate, terrified and homeless.
  Soon they learned the local language (which they referred to as `Up') and began work around the \gls{shadowVault}, cleaning, fixing, documenting the \glsfmtplural{artefact}, and crafting a impervious gate to ensure nothing else could emerge from the Vore Gate.}
\end{boxtext}

\histEvent{340}{1}{Six \glsentrytext{deep} gnomes emerge from the Vore Gate}

It has 4~\glspl{hp} and \gls{dr}~18, so players can destroy it by thinking of ways to raise their Damage sky-high, or by picking the lock with an \roll{Intelligence}{Larceny} roll at \tn[16].

\mapentry[shadowVore]{Vore Gate}

\begin{boxtext}
  The room is visible through the metal gate, and through the peep-holes%
  \footnote{Strange creatures used to emerge from the Vore Gate (as it loves to open itself for travellers).
  Some of them hid beside the gate, so nobody could see them.
  After a few of the \gls{temple}'s apprentices (and one important researcher) had their faces ripped off, the management decided to install peep-holes on either side.}
  at either side.
  From those locations, one can see two ivory pillars with a frozen miasma in the centre.
\end{boxtext}

If the \glspl{pc} manage to speak with the Vore Gate,%
\footnote{Perhaps with a \textit{Delicate Audience} spell.}
it tells them enthusiastically, and emphatically, `\textit{you \underline{must} see the wonders on the other side!}'.
It will lie about treasures, entice them with mysteries, but most of all it says how much it loves having people entering.

Last night, a \superWierdzi\ emerged from the Vore Gate, and it still wants to escape the enclosure.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  The \superWierdzi\ looks like a sickly-yellow mound of Van-Gogh playdough, but whenever someone looks at it, the \superWierdzi\ begins to look a little like them.
  \item
  The \superWierdzi\ can reduce any Body \gls{attribute} by up to 3 in order to imitate someone's appearance, but cannot make any noises.
  \item
  The acidic oozes (in rooms \vref{shadowPot} and \vref{shadowJelly})
  will not react to the \superWierdzi\ in any way.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{If the troupe look into the Vore Gate enclosure,}
the \superWierdzi\ tries to hide.
If it cannot (because all peep-holes have someone looking through them), it stares back through a peep-hole, absorbing \pgls{pc}'s face.

\paragraph{If it escapes,}
the \superWierdzi\ flees, then stops steps away, and stares at the troupe, imitating each of them in turn.
Ranged weapons will make it flee, and then hide outside, waiting to stare at the troupe again.

\paragraph{Letting it observe for 3 \glspl{round}}
allows it to duplicate someone's full bodily appearance exactly, at which point it attempts to return through the Vore Gate (but may wander outside for a few \glspl{cycle} if the Vore Gate is not available).

They can take it away, and it will continue to show the state of any Force spells in range.
It watches them with fascination, and refuses to do anything else.

Right now, it sits underwater, deprived of air and \glsentrylongpl{mp}.
And it desperately wants to know what is happening with \glsentrytext{shadowGate} (room \vref{shadowGate}).

\mapentry[shadowJelly]{Uncommon Ooze}

\histEvent{300}{1}{The six gnomes who work at \glsentrytext{shadowVault} build an alchemical gateway to \glsentrytext{archwarp} called `\glsentrytext{shadowGate}', and instruct it to open for anyone who can answer its riddles}

\begin{exampletext}
  The servants of the \gls{wheatGuild} did not receive many customers at \gls{shadowVault}, despite their marvellous attractions, because \gls{sixshadow} sat out of the way, with a long walk to its South, and the six mountains to its North.
  The six gnomes who worked there proposed a plan -- they required some \glspl{ingredient}, and would create another magical gateway.
  Unlike the Vore Gate, this one would transport things to a human settlement -- Archwarp.

  Once the gnomes completed `\gls{shadowGate}', people could stand in the sand-pits at either side, and \gls{shadowGate}  would arrange the sand to write a riddle.
  The requester then wrote the answer in the sand, and the gateway would open on a correct answer.

  The \gls{wheatGuild} did not feel terribly pleased about the situation, but the gnomes now had a source of permanent employment as `riddle-speakers', as \gls{shadowGate} only knew the riddles they had taught it.
\end{exampletext}

An acidic ooze sits down here, minding its own business.
Occasionally \pgls{woodspy} or \gls{basilisk} enters to look around or hibernate, and the ooze begins to eat it.
And sometimes that creature escapes, and sometimes it does not.
The ooze has existed here for a long time, and has grown to the size of a room.

\uncommonlyLargeJelly

The \glspl{pc} may find the ooze a serious problem.
It's deadly, humongous, hungry, and fearless.
But like any ooze, it's stupid, so the \glspl{pc} can lead it out of the temple, and the only way it can find its way back is to feel its own slime-trail.

\paragraph{During cold seasons,}
the ooze rests under the ice.

\paragraph{If the large ooze makes contact with the smaller ooze,}
(area \vref{shadowJelly})
they envelop each other, then mate for \pgls{interval}, then the larger one explodes into six copies of the smaller ooze.

Disturbing the pair during this time results in  both attacking at once.

\mapentry[shadowStaff]{Staff Door}

\begin{exampletext}
  The gnomes who worked here restricted access to one direction, so the staff could port people though the attractions, one at a time.
  They began with a one-way door, and then started work on a `janitor's closet'.

  The gnomes had always resented the \gls{wheatGuild} holding the only keys to the Vore Gate's enclosure.
  They did not want to return to their home in the \gls{deep}, but also didn't want anyone else making that decision for them.
  So with some slow, quiet work, over \pgls{cycle}, they created a passage from their little `janitor's closet' to the Vore Gate enclosure.
\end{exampletext}

This hallway remains dry.
The door only opens towards the stairs leading out, never the other way.
Pulling it out requires a \roll{Dexterity}{Crafts} roll (\tn[11]).

A little hole in the wall leads into the little Gnomish room, where they kept brushes and ledgers.
A black cloth covers the entrance, and in the darkness it simply looks like the back of the alcove.
A small, painted, vase completes the illusion, by explaining why the alcove exists.
The lines on the vase, look decorative, but they show the relative locations of the tunnels through the Vore Gate.
However, nobody knows its value, beyond its obvious beauty.

\mapentry[janitorCloset]{Janitor's Closet}

Inside this little room sit various cleaning-clothes, brushes, and records of income.
A single wall has wood over the front, leading to room \vref{shadowVore}.

\mapentry[shadowGate]{\Glsfmttext{shadowGate}}

\histEvent{270}{4}{%
  \Glsfmttext{warden} Klept Grey asks a gnome who works at \glsentrytext{shadowVault}, to destroy \gls{shadowGate}.
  Instead, he ask \gls{shadowGate} an impossible riddle, and \gls{shadowGate} stops working until it has solved the riddle.
  In return, the \gls{warden} allows the \gls{deep} gnomes to open a warren, just outside of \glsentrytext{town}}

\index{Riddles!\Glsfmtname{shadowGate}}
\index{Grey Family!Klept}%
\begin{exampletext}
  While \gls{shadowGate} ferried people from \gls{sixshadow} to \gls{archwarp}, it competed with \glsentrytext{town} for transportation access.
  \Glsentrytext{town}'s \glsentrytext{warden} hated having to lower his prices to compete, so he made a deal with the gnomes who worked at \gls{shadowVault}.
  He would let them build a warren right next to \glsentrytext{town}, and in return, they would break \gls{shadowGate}.

  Gnomes, as a general rule, dislike `breaking' things, especially \glsfmtplural{artefact}, but one found a way to halt the gateway.
  One night, after the humans had gone to bed, young \gls{keras} approached \gls{shadowGate}, and asked for the entry riddle.
  But instead of entering, \gls{keras} asked for another riddle to solve.
  After solving many more, he began to insult \gls{shadowGate}, saying its riddles were too easy, and it should `make a challenge, not small-talk'.

  Then \gls{keras} offered \gls{shadowGate} a new riddle -- something that would create a real challenge\ldots
\end{exampletext}

The entrance to \gls{shadowGate} stands about as tall as a human, so seeing the passage will be a challenge if the troupe get here by swimming atop the slimy water.

Over \gls{cTwo}, the troupe have even bigger problems -- they won't even see the entrance to \gls{shadowGate} as the water freezes.
The \glspl{pc} can roll \roll{Strength}{Crafts} (\tn[10]) to smash through this ice, which of course releases the ooze.

Two staircases, on either side of the causeway lead to two raised platforms, still blessedly dry.
Each has little walls to contain all the sand.
When \gls{shadowGate} wishes to speak, it uses a \textit{Warp Detailed Earth} spell to solidify and soften different parts of the sand, which spells out a riddle.

\Gls{shadowGate}'s last riddle remains on the floor, but this riddle has multiple stages, so once someone begins to answer the riddle, the sand will start to shift about.

\mapentry[shadowDesk]{Empty Desks}

\begin{exampletext}
  This room once had a steep stone staircase up to it.
  But with the guardians sleeping peacefully (\vpageref[above]{shadowGuardian}), the proprietor didn't want leave them unprotected (even with the gate present).
  So he ordered men to build a wall over the entrance, leaving a gap at the top so they could squeeze out.
\end{exampletext}

The entrance stands at almost double the height of a human, and only wide enough to crawl through, so not many will spot it.
(and anyone with a Strength of +4 will have to remove their armour to fit through)

With \roll{Wits}{Crafts} (\tn[14]) they might notice the bricks are a little different around that wall.
With \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} (\tn[12]) they see the small entrance, above.
Once the \glspl{pc} pass by the entrance, they can make a single roll for both checks.

  The Nuisance Orb once sat on display for everyone to see, as it would entertain people with illusions.
  But after one too many accidents%
  \footnote{One rampaging \gls{basilisk}, a false accusation of theft, and three accounts of indecent nudity.}
  the staff became irritated by it, and eventually locked it away.
\end{exampletext}

The Nuisance Orb cannot imitate people when locked in the little cell, and craves freedom more than anything.
It can spend 2~\glspl{mp} to `see' around itself, 2~\glspl{mp} to make a convincing illusion of something, or 2~\glspl{mp} to create convincing sound.

\paragraph{If anyone passes by,}
it creates an illusion of Goutscrape (area \vref{shadowGuardian}), begging to be let out of the cell.
The illusion will create realistic sound, and then the Nuisance Orb will have no further \glsentrylongpl{mp} to see anything, so it will make the illusion of Goutscrape lie down and sob inconsolably.

\Glspl{pc} can see through the illusion standing in the darkness with a \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} roll

the Orb will cause constant chaos and misunderstandings.
If it ever speaks, it does so by making an illusion of someone giving advice about what to do with the Orb.

\mapentry[shadowGuardian]{Sleeping Guardians}

\begin{exampletext}
  When the magical gateway shut, the local \gls{warden} tasked \pgls{doula} to resolve the situation.
  Like anyone in her position, she told an enchanting story about success, then delegated the task.

  Finding three people too young to know better, she arranged for some fancy clothes, and declared them `Masters of the Riddle', and `Keepers of the Gate'.
  Then she sent them into an enchanted state, preserving their bodies, and setting their minds to focus, without failure, on the single task of solving the riddle which had vexed all of \gls{valley}.
  And `within a year or so', she claimed, one of them would solve the riddle.

  The first thought about how much he hated Maths.
  The second thought about visualizing the riddle as a series of rivers, each one representing a possible set of questions and answers.
  The third had already gone to sleep to dream of sex with his attractive neighbour.

  With everyone's attention focussed on the `Masters of the Riddle', the \gls{doula} went home, and died peacefully some years later.

  The three rest in this hidden room to this day, still focussed on the same thoughts.
