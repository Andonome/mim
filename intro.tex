\subsection*{Overview}

This book evolved like a weird-looking mushroom.
It still has a few patterns, designed to fit worlds which no longer exist.
And sometimes the shape makes you wonder where one part ends and a segment begins, but only where those distinctions don't matter.
And like the best mushrooms, it should be consumed, almost literally.

\textit{Missions in Maitavale} is \emph{anti-collectible}.
Every man, woman, and spider in the book has a statblock, with \glsentrylongpl{hp} boxes, like this: \setcounter{wounds}{3} \boxStat{r12}, so you can score through their \glspl{hp} with the fanciest pen you have.
When the \glspl{pc} discover a map, you will have to tear that handout from the middle of the book.

And like a strange mushroom, it's tougher than it looks.
These stories accept player involvement and tangents as part of their natural cycle.
They evolved over many iterations to pack \glspl{npc} together into bundles of shared interests, so the death of \pgls{npc} may twist or scar the plot, but should never break it.

Over these tales, entire locations will vanish, and others appear.
And whether the \glspl{npc} live or die, the start of these stories will tell you where they want to go, but you will have to figure out how they grow from whatever position the players forge or fall into.

You're now the caretaker to a weird mushroom.
