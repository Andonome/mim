Priests lived here at the side of \pgls{village}, at the time acting as advisors to the nobility.
\Gls{necromancer} enjoyed his work, and studied hard.

Now the garden lies untended, but paradoxically has more life than it ever did when humans tended to the grounds.
The grass has grown long, the trees' fruit comes and goes according to the seasons, and the local area has become populated with a lot of apple trees.

\mapentry[antGrounds]{The Grounds}

All over the temple grounds, ghouls wander, or simply stand and stare
(depending upon which encounter the characters are on, this could be 50 -- 400).

A hundred broken arrow parts lie littered around the area, as \gls{necromancer} practices with his bow daily.

\stirgeSwarm

A swarm of stirges%
\exRef{judgement}{Judgement}{stirge}
has moved into the area, but continuously make the mistake of trying to feed from the dead.
As a result, they have become carriers for a nasty disease -- Breathrot.%
\exRef{judgement}{Judgement}{Breathrot}
Anyone stung by the stirges contracts Breathrot, and becoming less able to breathe until they find a cure, or death.

\mapentry[antHall]{The Hallway}

The shrine at the side of the hallway is composed of five skulls standing on top of each other, all raised on a pillar.

\paragraph{Reading the archaic writing}
requires an Intelligence + Academics check, TN 10.

Each skull has a female name, and a message thanking all those below for life.
Anyone saying a prayer of gratitude to their matrilineal lineage in front of the item gains $1D6+3$ \glspl{fp}.%
\footnote{The item has 9 MP in total, and spends 2 MP to cast the spell.}

\mapentry[antBasilisk]{the Preserved Basilisk}

\textbf{Background:}
\Gls{necromancer} felled a basilisk recently.
He worries about raising it as a ghoul, as such a larger creature might cause havoc, and he does not know if his prayers are up to the task.

It remains here, with a \textit{Preservation} spell to ensure the corpse does not rot.
He is slowly building armour around it, to create an unstoppable ghoul, but has not completed the armour (it will fall off after taking 2 hits if the creature wakes up).

\mapentry[antStudy]{The Secret Study}

When the bandits are away, \gls{necromancer} sneaks back to his private study, through a stone door, balanced on massive iron hinges.
It contains three cages with birds, scattered throughout the room.

The books and scrolls consist of:

\begin{itemize}

  \item
  Prayers to the dead (lots)
  \item
  Old letters praising all the new food passing through the area, as `our under-cousins' do business.
  \item
  Letters noting the best routes from one village to another.
  These are a clue as to the original layout of \gls{lostcity}, and also confirm that the city never stretched across the entire area, but simply contained a number of \glspl{village}.
  \item
  A workshop bench with various pieces of armour on it, including a complete suite of chain.
  \item
  A small chest containing \lootMedium.

\end{itemize}

\mapentry[antPrison]{The Prison}

This room once housed people making important decisions.  \Gls{necromancer} now uses it to house prisoners so he can feed off their souls.
Currently, it contains one terrified farmer called Laith.
He's starving, and petrified, as every day all he can hear are the shambling dead, who sometimes come to grope at the locked door.
\Gls{necromancer}, or course, holds the key.

Picking the lock requires an Intelligence + Larceny roll, TN 7.

Laith can join the characters if given a weapon, but he won't be terribly effective.

\mapentry[antCamp]{The Abandoned Camp}

\textbf{Background:}
The Immortal Bandits stayed here for a while, as \gls{banditking} made arrangements with \gls{necromancer}.
They had to leave once the place became too full of undead, but their bedding and old firepit remain.

\paragraph{Investigating the bedding}
shows a pair of gloves, bedding, and other standard items which distinctly come from Whiteplains, although understanding what this means requires and Intelligence + Crafts roll (TN 12).

\mapentry[antOgre]{The Undead Ogre}

\Gls{necromancer}'s prized specimen -- an undead ogre.
\Gls{necromancer} killed the ogre some time ago, and pulled the body back to undeath.
Since then, \gls{necromancer} has cobbled together leather armour to glad the oversized ghoul in.
Now he stands humongous and impenetrable.

\mapentry[antTower]{The Watchtower}

This tower once hosted a call to prayer the nearby village could hear.
Now \gls{necromancer} uses it to practice his longbow daily, or shoot at intruders.

A large stockpile of arrows sits at the side of the little room.
