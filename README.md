> The towns are only safe so long as the villages feed them.
> The villages are only safe due to the patrols, and their outer walls.
> If we lose another village, the town will fall.
> When we lose the town, we lose the foundries, and swords.
> We'll become like the lost city - an abandoned waste where the trees grow over the churches.
>
> Or you can fight back, join the Night Guard at the forest's border, fight back against the creatures that steal our sheep and scare our horses.
> It's not like you have a choice.

Over a dozen *Side Quests* slot together to form an over-arching plot.
PCs can wander as they please, with different parts of each quest waiting for them in every corner of Mt Arthur's Grey Valley.

The module comes with a great many handouts - mostly maps which the players can discover in the various areas.
