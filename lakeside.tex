Lakeside is a small, walled, village near the \gls{edge}, with a large and proud temple to Ohta resting at its side, waiting for battle.

The tall stone walls reach 4 metres into the air.
The bridges are made of wood, and ready to burn at a moment's notice if either side of the village falls to some enemy.
The river running through the centre is not dangerous, but is strong enough to sweep almost anyone away if they try to swim against it.

Lakeside has an unusually large number of well-armed young soldiers, ready to fight for their little patch of the world at a moment's notice.
It is lead by \Gls{village} Master Cronblight, who is also the area's leader of the weapons' guild -- a small organization who are permitted to produce weapons, which are then sold to the \gls{guard}.

The ports here provide an important trade to the surrounding areas, and the river provides a relatively safe route out of the area.
This port provides the only  source of raw iron to the town, so if the village ever perishes, the price of weapons will double.

\paragraph{If you use this area for a ghoul attack with \gls{necromancer},}
the ghouls approach underwater and come up from the river.

\mapentry[lakeSquare]{Central Square}

The town's central square contains a statue of \gls{king} looking lordly.
It was built over a level 2 mana lake, so the entire town will allow a spell-caster to regenerate 1 MP per turn, and anyone closer to the statue will regenerate 2 per turn.

As only officials of the Temple of Ohta can sell weapons, the village takes pains to show support to \gls{king}, as the weapons provide the majority of its wealth.

\mapentry[lakeTemple]{Ohta's House}

The miniature citadel houses over 1,000 swords, 2,000 shields, and 20,000 arrows, ready for sale.
The \glspl{pc} can buy just about any weapon they can name here, all for the basic prices in the core rules.

\paragraph{If \pgls{pc} follows the code of Ohta,}
they can pray in the temple, or donate for XP.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} are looking to hire a soldier,}
they will find capable people here.

\mapentry[lakeDocks]{Docks}

Here, boats from the Shale enter, carrying dwarvish spirits.
