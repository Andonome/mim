\section{A Tapestry of Karma}
\label{sqSummaries}

\begin{multicols}{2}

% Theme: Karma

\noindent
Each of the nine stories revolves around a central theme: the subtle line between karma and vengeance.
In the case of the \nameref{spiderSong}, the \gls{spiderqueen} kills people, and slays hamlets, until her enemies mount up; eventually, the \glspl{pc} will find someone willing to help kill her, making the \glspl{pc} an instrument of karmic vengeance for the \gls{valley}.
While this happens, the \nameref{wolfHeads} story begins, and the \glspl{pc} will a series of suspicious characters, but cannot demonstrate any definitive harm or crime they have committed.
The two groups will have to cement their attitude towards each other before the end, as they stumble upon the \glspl{pc} just as the \glspl{pc} deal with a dangerous situation.
Then sometime later, the same happens in reverse, and the \glspl{pc} will find the \gls{wolfhead} troupe wounded, and close to death.
They may end up repaying a debt, or grab at the chance for vengeance, depending on the troupes' relationship to each other.

% SQ.

Each of the \glspl{sq} uses a specific structure which allows you to present them in \glspl{segment}.
Some start with \pgls{segment} simply for foreshadowing -- something to give the players a feint memory to hang onto and a hint of things to come.
And each one should work with a changeable table, where some players have to miss a week or two, and new players arrive mid-way through the \gls{campaign}, because the heart of the narrative does not arrive during any particular \gls{segment} or \gls{sq} -- the `main plot' comes out of the collection of threads, which combine into a central narrative.

% Map + regions

\subsubsection{Geography}
shapes the \gls{campaign} in two ways.
First, the \glspl{sq} split into \glspl{segment}, and each \gls{segment} lives on one of the main areas on the map, waiting patiently to ambush the \glspl{pc}.

\paragraph{The forest}
surrounds the \gls{valley}, so the moment the \glspl{pc} step foot past the \gls{edge}, you can look for the next available \gls{segment} which takes place in the forest.
Every forest \gls{segment} should fit into your game, regardless of where on the map the \glspl{pc} have gone.

\paragraph{The roads}
lie between the forest and town, so each time the \glspl{pc} go from one to the other, they must pass through the roads which link all the \glspl{village} in the \gls{valley} together.
Some \glspl{segment} might make sense when the \glspl{pc} awaken in \pgls{bothy}, or if they stay in \pgls{village}; but if not, then all of them will make sense when the \glspl{pc} travel along the roads.%
\footnote{Of course, this has already been covered, in the glossary, \vpageref{glosPreamble}, which you must have read already.
Otherwise that would make you a mad person, who skips past random spots in their books, attempting to make sense of them in random order.}

While the forest presents grand, solitary, \glspl{segment}, the road has some \glspl{segment} with a `\squash' symbol next to them.
This indicates that you should run the next available \gls{segment} immediately, tying both of them together.
This might mean double-trouble for the \glspl{pc}, who end up fighting two enemies at the same time, or it might mean a conversation interrupted by combat.

\paragraph{The town}
forms the nexus of news for the \gls{valley}, much of it bad.
The forest holds \glspl{fiend} -- \gls{spiderqueen}, \gls{necromancer}, and \gls{whiteBandits} -- who can destroy entire \glspl{broch} and \glspl{village}.
If this happens, \gls{valley}'s geography will change rapidly.

Check out the map \vpageref{Irina/greylands}.
Notice the protective barrier of \glspl{broch} and \glspl{village} forming a thin, protective barrier against the \gls{edge}.
If the outer protection falls, \glspl{monster} will become far more common inside the defenceless, inner farmland, where hamlets raise all the livestock.
Once meat production goes down and danger goes up, traders will refuse to use a road, then nearby \glspl{village} will not have enough provisions to survive the cold seasons, and will have to move.

One by one, by \gls{village} and \gls{broch}, \gls{valley} would collapse, leaving the \glspl{fiend} to consume the last, weakened, inhabitants.

\subsubsection{Trek a Path}
through the \gls{campaign} with your finger, to see how it might unfold.
If the \glspl{pc} go to town quickly, you would begin the \gls{sq} `\nameref{troubleAle}'.
But if they pass through the first two \glspl{segment} of the \nameref{wolfHeads} \gls{sq} first, then the \glspl{pc} will hear what the \gls{wolfhead} troupe have been up to, and may meet \gls{southRogue} the very moment they leave \gls{town}.

If all these little frayed ends seem confusing, just skip to \vpageref{spiderSong} and read \nameref{spiderSong} -- every \gls{sq} has a short, easy plot when looked at alone.

\subsection{Getting Started}

Every session goes the same way:

\input{config/start.tex}

The first session should follow the same pattern, including players explaining to \pgls{jotter} how they ended up in the \gls{guard}.
%! Write up a starting broch
The first scene should begin in \pgls{broch}, somewhere on the `Roads'.
This area covers everywhere outside of \gls{town}, up to the forest, so it constitutes most of the map \vpageref{Irina/greylands}.

Standard \gls{guard} duties%
\exRef{judgement}{Judgement}{NGmissions}
include transporting trader caravans on their ways between \gls{town} and the outer \glspl{village}.
The pleasant areas, closer to \gls{town}, see more traders and travellers than monsters, while the distance \glspl{village} have roads piercing the forest, and must push back massive predators almost daily.

Once the \glspl{jotter} send them this way and that, they will instantly find \glspl{sq} assaulting them daily, or weekly, or at any pace you like, and the players will eventually investigate at least one lead.

Throughout this time, \glspl{pc} should receive all the standard encounter rolls.
Mixing the lot -- encounters and plots, \glspl{sq} and \gls{guard} missions -- creates a maelstrom of twists and turns.
This can be a lot of fun, but it also threatens the players' focus, so it's best to remember to pull that focus back to whatever the players think of as their primary mission.
This may change half way through the mission, or they may disagree about what's important; and both of those results are fine.
However, if the players ever feel \emph{confused} about what their characters should be doing, they will quickly disconnect from \gls{fenestra}, and start staring into their rectangles.

Chaos, and focus should flow like breathing in and out.

\subsubsection{Let Players `Ruin' the Mission}
because the \glspl{sq} below can withstand a lot of punishment from the players.
If \gls{segment}~1 of a \gls{sq} goes haywire, \gls{segment}~2 can usually take place unscathed, or with minor adjustments.
But you should let the players change the world, otherwise what is the point of this world?

When \glspl{pc}' actions threaten to derail \pgls{sq}, you have options.

\begin{description}
  \item[If the \glspl{pc} kill a major character]
  use another.
  It's no accident that two brothers lead the \gls{whiteBandits}.
  If \gls{sewerking} dies, \gls{banditking} can take over most of his duties.
  Similarly, \gls{pigowner} can also take over any of \gls{alemaster}'s \glspl{segment}, as they're both members of the \gls{wheatGuild}.
  \item[If the group decide to join the \gls{whiteBandits}]
  adjust!
  So they don't want to be in the \gls{guard} any more -- that's quite understandable.
  So they will have to listen to \gls{banditking} instead of \gls{traitor}.
  \Gls{sewerking} still has plenty of missions for them.
  \item[When all else fails]
  just cut out the \gls{sq}.
  If the \glspl{pc} somehow kill \gls{spiderqueen} during part 1, the campaign only loses a few \glspl{segment}.
  The campaign has plenty more to give!
