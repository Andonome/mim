If the citizens of the surrounding lands overrun Redfall (see \autopageref{mastersBounty}), it becomes a hotbed for nura.
They eat the servants, and soon after Krela, the goblin nuramancer, arrived from one of the open nura portals in the land.

Krela eats well with the \glspl{ogre}, and soon builds up \pgls{ogre} army.
The nura begin eating their way through the surrounding \glspl{village}, while Krela transforms humans into \glspl{ogre}.

The central fort continues amassing arms, and the \glspl{ogre} throw boulders at anyone who comes too close.

\mapentry[keep_ogres]{Philosophical \Glsfmtplural{ogre}}

Four \glspl{ogre} discuss if they are men, transformed, or \glspl{ogre} with the stolen memories of humans.

\ogre[\npc{\T[4]\N\Hu}{Four Ogres}]

\mapentry[keep_patrol]{Patrolling Ogre}

A single \gls{ogre} patrols the keep.
He will talk with anyone who looks unthreatening, as he has eaten well already.
Otherwise, he attacks.

If Thorn the diplomat survived, this \gls{ogre} is Thorn, and he hates Krela for taking his position as advisor.
He will help assassinate her, but not if it means putting \gls{nurabaron} in danger.

\mapentry[keep_prisoners]{Prisoners}

Four prisoners await death, once the \glspl{ogre} become hungry enough.

\mapentry[nuramancer_tower]{Nuramancer}

The goblin advises \gls{nurabaron}, and will use her vantage point to cast offensive spells at anyone attacking the keep.
