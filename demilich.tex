\sidequest[Roads,Forest,Town]{The Necromancer's Friends}

\begin{exampletext}
  \noindent
  \Gls{necromancer} swore to protect his temple forever, but never said what he would protect it from.
  After he died, he continued his sole task while undead (as so many in the old temples of \gls{eldren} did back in the day).
  He always enjoyed bird-watching, which he could continue to do from his lonely tower.

  When the nearby \glspl{village} fell to ruin, he continued.
  When the people in his own town and temple left, he remained, staring quietly at the world, and saw his temple crumble around him.

  After time lost its meaning, bandits came to rest within his temple.
  He summoned a mist to suffocate them in their sleep, drained their souls, tore them apart, stuffed their bladders into their own skulls out of contempt, then stood to admire what he had created.

  The \gls{artefact} at once stood as an insult to the robbers, and a beautiful mark of change -- something \gls{necromancer} had not seen in a long time.
  He spent the energy, gained from the robbers, on a knot of spells.
  First, a Preservation spell ensured the item would not degrade.
  Then, he twisted the little preservation spell into a real mind.
  He spoke to the new creation, though it could not understand much of anything, yet.
  He indicated (silently, without moving his physical body) to observe the tiny flecks of souls which dart around the trees, and explained that these were birds.
  The \textit{Bladder Skull} could not speak, or move, but \gls{necromancer} could see some response in the simple, silent, language of the dead.

  Sometimes, \gls{necromancer} would teach the skull about magical Spheres, which it slowly learned, or teach it to detect the subtle, little souls of insects when they try to eat your feet.
  And since the Bladder Skull was not undead (despite its body of three bladders, inflated eternally, and stuffed inside three skulls), it could absorb the magical energies of the world.

  \Gls{necromancer} and the Skull Bladder Philosophized, and watched the birds together, and forgot that time existed.

  But time persisted, and one day brought two souls to the temple.
  The dead can see a sentient soul in the far distance, like a shining light in the darkness.
  In fact, they can see very little else.
  \Gls{necromancer} had not seen a living soul in such a long time that he felt a tiny touch of fear, but for someone who spends centuries watching the soul-specks of birds and bee-hives, the tiniest touch of fear felt like a horse galloping towards him.
  He moved to the top tower, and picked up his ivory bow (preserved with another spell).

  Drawing an arrow back, he saw the two lights fleeing his temple, and felt horror.
  Worse than his broken oath to protect the temple, centuries of solitude had given him a phobia of living people.
  And to make matters worse, those little souls had picked up the Bladder Skull!

  He shot an arrow, wounding one, then missed with several others.
  \Gls{necromancer} stood like only the dead can stand, and silently mourned his broken oath, and lost friend.

\end{exampletext}

\noindent
\Gls{necromancer} has a plan.
He wants an army of ghouls surrounding his temple, to ensure no more \emph{people} approach his temple.
He wants armour, to protect himself.
Since movement drains his energy, he will need a steady supply of unconscious people, so he can drain their souls (he feels brave enough to approach people when they're not awake).

Unfortunately, doing all this will make \gls{necromancer} paranoid about people coming to end his existence, which drives him to seek a larger army, and more living prisoners.

\subsubsection{Searching for \Glsentrytext{necromancer}'s Lair}
\label{huntingNecro}
The \glspl{pc} have a number of options, all of them bad.

\Gls{town}'s \gls{paperGuild}%
\footnote{See \autopageref{paperGuild}.}
has records of the original temple, but they could only research about him if they have something to go on.
A successful \roll{Intelligence}{Academics} roll (\tn[12]) reveals the map in the handouts, and reaching \tn[13] reveals the location.

Following the tracks will take a long time, although a horde of hundreds will be rather easy to follow.
The \glspl{pc} can roll \roll{Wits}{Wyldcrafting} at \tn[5], with +2 to the \gls{tn} each day thereafter, and +3 on any day it rains or snows.

\begin{boxtext}
  Crackling sticks indicate someone walks close by, and a moment later indicates a full procession walking somewhere close by.
  But you wait, and no voices come out -- only crackling sticks.
\end{boxtext}

\sqpart{Roads}% AREA
{\gls{vlg}~The Undead Horde}% NAME
{A botched spell leaves \glsentrytext{necromancer}'s ghouls wandering alone}% SUMMARY

\begin{exampletext}
  \Gls{necromancer}'s first attempt at raiding \pgls{village} did not go according to plan.
  His foul fog made everyone sick.
  Most of the \gls{village} scattered, and he entered to kill the few remaining inside, and consume their souls.
  He stuffed dead spirits inside their empty shells, to irse and consume the living.

  Each of the new ghouls fled in a different direction, chasing the living.
  He spent a little while trying to round them up, but they had gone beyond the range of his spells.

  Eventually, he gave up and returned to his temple, while the dead stood scattered, from river to hill.
\end{exampletext}

Run this part when the troupe approach \pgls{village} which \gls{necromancer} might travel to.
His temple is marked with a `\gls{D}' on the map (\vpageref{Irina/greylands}, and lies upstream of a number of \glspl{village} and hamlets.
He can comfortably travel downriver, since he has no need to breathe.%
\Gls{necromancer} will never return via roads -- instead, he uses the light which comes off \glspl{village} like sailors use starlight.
\footnote{He can also cast Air spells to float a little.}

\paragraph{Initially}
you should ease slowly into a mounting sense of dread.

\begin{boxtext}
  Half the houses give off weak smoke, but every door lies open, as if trying to show you the empty darkness inside.
  The only sound comes from upset sheep, pleading for food.

  Behind you, a single farmer has returned to the \gls{village}.
  He approaches you, with a sense of urgency\ldots
\end{boxtext}

\ghoul[\npc{\D}{Ghoulish Farmer}]

\paragraph{In part 2,}
the dead pile on bit by bit.

\ghoul[\npc{\T[3]\D}{More Ghouls}]

\ghoul[\npc{\T[7]\D}{Still More Ghouls}]

Over 100 ghouls head towards them, so keep adding a larger amount each time, until the \glspl{pc} run (or die, with bravery, honour, and through stupidity).

\paragraph{Once the troupe realize they need to flee}
they can add \pgls{fatigue}, and march 2 miles away, and will probably out-pace the ghouls.

Ask them `where to next?', and continue as if the scene has ended.
They may head back along the road, or try to go around the ghoulish \gls{village}, by taking a short detour through the forest.

Once the scene settles, have them roll \roll{Intelligence}{Stealth} (\tn[12]).
Success means that they understand how far the dead can see, and how to hide the light of their souls.%
\footnote{Thick clothing helps, as long as it covers everything. Hills and rivers also helps, as they block some of the light of a soul, just like any other light.}
Failure means they ghouls catch up, this time travelling together, as an army.

\paragraph{If they flee to \pgls{bothy},}
they will find safety, but risk starvation.
Roll encounters as usual -- the ghouls will attack any traders or woodspies which approach, but soon enough return to the \gls{bothy} unless the troupe manage to hide themselves well enough.

\paragraph{If they flee to \pgls{village},}
then the archers there can help pick off the dead, but they will run out of arrows before the ghouls all drop down\ldots immobile.

\paragraph{If they encounter a basilisk,}
then they have been saved!
(basilisks have no problem eating ghouls, and the ghouls will not find killing it an easy task)

\paragraph{Tracking down \gls{necromancer}}
presents a thousand challenges.
Have the players roll \roll{Wits}{Wyldcrafting} (\tn[14] or higher) if they figure out that someone started the massacre, and attempt to track them.

\paragraph{Whatever happens,}
you will have to think on your feet to interpret the clashing of plans with events, as will the players.

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{\gls{vlg}~\squash Rumours of a Breach}% NAME
{\Glsentrytext{necromancer} destroys \pgls{village} at the \Glsentrytext{edge}}% SUMMARY

\Gls{necromancer} has destroyed yet another \gls{village}, and now has a horde of \arabic{sqNo}00 ghouls, along with a few ghasts.
\Glspl{guard} found the \gls{village} two days ago, and now all of \gls{town} is talking about it.

By this time, \gls{necromancer} has gathered an army of \arabic{sqNo}00 undead.

\sqpart{Roads}% AREA
{\gls{vlg}~The Survivors}% NAME
{A few farmers flee a massacre}% SUMMARY

\begin{exampletext}
  Last night, \gls{necromancer} attacked \pgls{village}, successfully created some ghouls, then enchanted them to follow him.
  \Gls{necromancer} noted that they carried a necklage with the symbol of \gls{eldren} -- `\gls{sickness}' -- and instructed the ghouls to spare them.
\end{exampletext}

Run this part only when somewhere close the \gls{necromancer}'s temple, or somewhere downriver, West of \gls{town}.
Remember to roll encounters as usual, and combine that encounter with the fleeing farmers.

\begin{boxtext}
  On the horizon, four humanoid silhouettes stumble forward silently.
  Once they see you, they start running towards you.
\end{boxtext}

The farmers arrive famished, and request all the food the troupe can spare.

One of the survivors -- Fangkrist -- has been affected by a \textit{Soul Specks} spell.
\Gls{necromancer} cast it on him in order to communicate, and continuously ask where his `beloved Bladder Skull' went.

Fangkrist will tell everyone what he saw, and ask how to break the curse, before explaining the strange things he can see.
The curse wears off by the end of the day, as long as he keeps moving.

\begin{speechtext}
  I can see your inner lights.
  They feel blinding.
  Especially \emph{yours}%
  \footnote{He directs this at whoever has the most \glspl{mp}, assuming anyone has any.}
  What did that creature in the darkness mean?
  He kept on saying it.

  ``My beloved Bladder Skull''

  ``Where did they take my Bladder Skull?''
\end{speechtext}

\paragraph{If the characters try to track the ghoulish army,}
they find only one challenge -- if they approach too close, the ghouls may turn, and attack.
An \roll{Intelligence}{Wyldcrafting} roll (\tn[10]) lets them keep the proper distance.

The \nameref{necromancers_lair} now hosts \arabic{sqNo}00 ghouls, a few ghasts, and an undead basilisk.%
\footnote{See \nameref{antBasilisk}, \autopageref{antBasilisk}.}
The farmers will not accompany the troupe when pursuing the undead horde.

Mark off another \gls{village} on the \gls{valley} map.

{\squash Armourless}% NAME
{\Glsentrytext{necromancer} kills a trading wagon for their armour}% SUMMARY

\begin{exampletext}
  \Gls{necromancer}'s ghasts journeyed out on a mission -- to sieze armour for him.
  They found a trading caravan, with one wagon of armour from \gls{southDale} -- leather, chain, helmets, brigadine, the elf-stuff -- she had the lot.
\end{exampletext}

The prices of armour in all of \gls{valley} doubles after this event, for the next month.
That single wagon may not have carried all \emph{that much}, but when supply problems appear, people panic-buy.

\Gls{necromancer} now has a horde of \arabic{sqNo}00 ghouls, along with a few ghasts, and an undead, armour-plated basilisk.
If the troupe try to track him down, remember to check \vpageref{huntingNecro}.

\sqpart{Roads}% AREA
{The Dead Devour}% NAME
{The necromancer makes a full-on assault on \pgls{village}}% SUMMARY

\begin{figure*}[t]
\begin{boxtable}

  Roll & Result \\\hline

  $14$ & The troupe somehow spot the dead in the distance, and have 10 rounds to organize. \\

  $10$ & The troupe notice the dead almost too late, and have 3 rounds before the dead engage the village in combat. \\

  $9$ & The troupe have only 2 rounds before the dead engage the village in combat. \\

  $8$ & The dead surround the village entirely before being spotted, and the troupe first hear of the dead when they enter the village and begin tearing a house apart. \\

  $<8$ & The cries of war are mistaken for a normal scuffle, and the moment the troupe investigate, they are engaged in combat. \\

\end{boxtable}
\end{figure*}

\textbf{Background:}
\glsfirst{necromancer} has gathered an army of a full 400 undead, and has decided to take most of them to a nearby village, and kill everyone inside.
Whichever \gls{village} the troupe have arrived at (or near), is the one he assaults.

\begin{boxtext}
  The village falls quiet at night, except for shuffling feet as people try to be quiet going out to the toilet at night, or chattering about local town gossip.

  A man in the distance tells his child off harshly for going out at night into the forest with his friends.
\end{boxtext}

His tactics are to create a full ring of undead around the village, and pull it slowly tighter until the entire village is surrounded.
Once there is nowhere to go, he releases the undead to attack.

The troupe can make a \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} roll (\tn[10]) to spot the dead before they attack.

\paragraph{Preparation} depends upon a single Tactics roll.
If the troupe see the dead before the dead arrive, they can make an Intelligence + Tactics roll, TN 6.
Otherwise, they can make a Wits + Tactics roll, TN 10.
Each margin on the roll decreases the number of round the troupe must fight before the dead retreat.
If the margin is 0 or less, the dead attack for 6 rounds before more raise.

\begin{boxtext}

  The screams outside get louder and louder.
  Outside the window you can see some enemy, rising from the river.
  They're pouring out like a reverse waterfall, with every part of the bank filled end to end.

\end{boxtext}

For tactical purpose, divide the village into four quadrants -- perhaps `the well', `the hallway', `the fields', and `the shrine', or whatever fits the village the characters have ended in.

Each quadrant is attacked by 50 ghouls, while the necromancer stays around the outside, picking off anyone who tries to escape.  He starts with hit hunting bow -- his undead sight allows him to spot people in the dark with ease.  After that, he uses magic, starting with curses, then invocation magic.

The entire village attack together.
While many may attack each round, each character only has to face the number of ghouls attacking them personally.
Use the following as a guide:

\begin{boxtable}

  Round 1 & 4 ghouls attack. \\

  Round 2 & 5 ghouls attack. \\

  Round 3 & 5 ghouls attack. \\

  Round 4 & Nearby houses go down, torn apart by the dead. \\

  Round 5 & All houses a broken, and the dead invade.
  3 more ghouls attack. \\

  Round 6 & Those already dead rise again as the necromancer completes a spell. \\

  Round 7 & 2 ghouls attack. \\

  Round 8 & The dead retreat at the necromancer's order, and any dead villagers return with him. \\

\end{boxtable}

Anyone carrying obvious trinkets displaying an allegiance to Qualm\"e may be spared by \gls{necromancer}'s curses, so long as they are not actively attacking the dead.

\paragraph{Cleanup} depends upon the battle's outcome.
Once the battle's over, the village will most likely be mostly destroyed, and \gls{necromancer}'s army much larger.  The villagers will shake, huddle together, and most consider moving.

The encounter repeats every second Village-encounter until the \glspl{pc} intervene.
