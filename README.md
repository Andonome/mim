*Missions in Maitavale* is a complete campaign for the BIND RPG.

Various factions have loosely intersecting plots, which cast their shadows across the PCs while they just try to do their regular Night Guard jobs.
The various crossing threads of the myriad factions use a new way to weave tales together in small segments: the *Side Quest* system, where the larger plot comes together from interwoven strands.

# Getting the Book

## The Map

A thousand monsters wander below, so humanity must plan accordingly.
The outer villages have walls, and survive by posting archers during the day, and huddling inside their houses at night, while tendrils and mandibles feel around every dwelling for an opening.

Along the road, bothies and brochs allow safe-havens for anyone wandering along the road.

The inner hamlets peacefully farm, safe in the knowledge that curious predators will head towards the noises of the other civilized areas.
Of course, this doesn't always work, so Greytown sends out its criminals, scum, and political agitators to ensure protection for every bailey in the Grey Valley.

Enter the PCs, charged with defending this peace.

Throughout the various stories, one bailey after another could fall.
And if the perimeter falls, a deluge of predators will feast on the soft inner areas.
