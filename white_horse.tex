\begin{boxtext}

  A massive man with a butter-tipped moustache throws a lanky man from the door.
  The lanky man recoils with a grimace, and shouts `you owe me my wages!'.

\end{boxtext}

\textbf{Background:}
\Gls{sewerthief} took a job as a cook at \gls{whitehorse} to learn more about \gls{townmaster}, but \gls{townmaster} instantly took umbrage at his Whiteplains accent.

If the PCs agree with Elric about \gls{sewerthief} (and about Whiteplains in general), then Vernon lets them in.

\mapentry[horseHall]{Drinking Hall}

The hall contains various villagemasters playing games, and half a dozen local guards (sometimes including \gls{captain}).

\mapentry[horseKitch]{Kitchen}

The staff sleep here during long shifts.  The lack of proper ventilation makes the air difficult to breathe.

\mapentry[horseYard]{The Courtyard}

\begin{boxtext}

  \Gls{townmaster} is running away from a coterie of chuckling men with his hands tied behind his back.
   A chicken runs out in front of him with a little paper hat.
   He lunges forwards and grabs the chicken in his teeth, then shakes it like a mad dog until it stops squawking.
   He gives a triumphant grin as the crowd clap and another man steps forward to have his hands tied.

\end{boxtext}

The courtyard usually contains a couple of carriages, and nobles playing ridiculous games.

If the troupe left the deer from the story `Here and No Farther' with \gls{alchemist}, they will find it abandoned here, doing little tricks for the amusement of local nobles.
\footnote{See \autopageref{seeADeer}.}

\mapentry[horseUpstairs]{Upstairs}

Upstairs contains two rooms, a load of equipment for the tavern, sleeping mats for favoured servants, and bookshelves.

The bookshelves contain rather a lot of history books, most focussing upon anti-elven propaganda, such as the time they destroyed the now-lost city.

\Gls{beardedalemaster} and Courtbile of the Wolf Heads sleep in the larger room.%
\footnote{See page \pageref{wolfHeads} for the Wolf Heads.}
\Gls{whitehorse} has no locks as nobody expects commoners to enter in the first place.
