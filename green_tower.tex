\begin{exampletext}
  Some centuries past, in the time of \gls{lostcity}, a temple of \gls{eldren} stood here, and dug down into the depths to find places to store the heaps of donations people gave them.
  The diggers soon stumbled into a cave-shaft, going straight down, where little glowing mushrooms glowed green.%
  \exRef{judgement}{Judgement}{glowshroom}

  These `glowshrooms' serve as Fire \glspl{ingredient}, so the \glspl{helper} started `fishing' for them, with little fishing hooks.

  When little goblins poked their heads out from the lower side of the shaft, the situation could only go one way.
  The golden priests spoke sickness into the air, and sent it down to kill the goblins, and the goblins would occasionally try various tricks, such as holding their breath, or sending big hobgoblins to climb quickly up the tunnel and attack.

  Eventually the surrounding civilization fell, as so many do, so the town and the tower fell to ruin, but the golden priests endured, and continued to pick mushrooms and fight against anyone who picked them.
  They forgot the town, and forgot their own names, but an enchantment kept them focussed on their single goal -- pick mushrooms, and drink the souls of anything that interferes with this mission.
\end{exampletext}

\begin{exampletext}
  \Gls{southSeeker} identified this spot as a potential site with one of the magical gateways of \gls{lostcity}, or at least nearby.
  After locating the tower, he organized men from the nearest \gls{village} to come and work on it, while \gls{beardedalemaster} paid their wages.

  \Gls{southSeeker} has figured out that the tower doesn't have a magical gateway, but thinks one might lie close, so he wants to use \gls{greentower} as a base of opearation.
\end{exampletext}

\mapentry[greenGrounds]{Outer Grounds}

The area around the tower contains piles of rock which labourers have collected from the surrounding ruins.

\paragraph{If anyone detects source of mana,}
they notice something in the area, but will have trouble pinpointing it without triangulation.
The little trickle in fact comes from a small opening to the abandoned basement (area \ref{underGreenTower} on the map).

The rock has a \gls{weight} of 12.

\paragraph{The masons}
work outside during the day, and will almost certainly notice the \glspl{pc} walking towards them, from the forest.
And with no roads in, they will feel immediate suspicion.
Seeing \gls{guard} uniforms will only deepen their worries.

Unless the \glspl{pc} give them a reason not to, they masons will act friendly, offer them a drink on the top floor (area \ref{greenTop}), lock the trapdoor from below, and leave them to the wind and the griffins.%

\humanfarmer[\npc{\T[6]\M\Hu}{6 Masons}]

\mapentry[greenConservatory]{Conservatory}

Overnight, the labouring equipment rests here.
The lock is a simple knot tied on the inside.
Getting in is easy -- \roll{Intelligence}{Larceny} (\tn[6]) to slide a knife through a crack and cut the rope.
Getting in undetected requires more thinking -- \roll{Intelligence}{Larceny} (\tn[14]) to thread a series of strings through, and create the leverage to undo the knot.

\mapentry[green1]{First Floor}

Basic straw-stuffed beds, clothes, and 10 longbows lie here (+2 Damage).

\mapentry[green2]{Second Floor}

The men sleep here, though it's eventually planned as a station for lower-level archers.

\mapentry[green3]{Third Floor}

The top floor provides a place for \gls{southSeeker}, overseer of the operation, to get a good look at the surrounding area.
This is also where he keeps a stockpile of weapons:

\begin{description}
  \item[Wall Rack]
  with
  20 longbows
  \item[Leather bundles]
  with
  50 longswords
  \item[Wooden Chest 1]
  with
  50 suits of partial leather armour
  \item[Wooden Chest 2]
  with
  50 suits of partial chain armour
  \item[Small Chest]
  contains:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    Fire \gls{boon}
    \item
    Air \gls{boon}
    \item
    Earth \gls{boon}
    \item
    \lootMagic
  \end{itemize}
\end{description}

\addtocounter{treasure}{-1}
\Gls{southSeeker} purchased the \lootMagic\ some years ago, and left it here to ensure none of the \gls{sunGuard} would search him in \gls{town}, and take it from him.

\mapentry[greenTop]{Top Floor}

This green roof meshes with the local trees for some distance around, but like any other camouflage, it seems obvious once you look at it.

From the top of the roof, anyone can see for miles around.
They can't see people or creatures sneaking about, but they can see basilisks and groups of men without fail, even by moonlight.

\begin{exampletext}
  Before the happy-go-lucky \gls{healersGuild} we know today, they studied the magic of the Death Sphere.
  `Priests' of high standing would volunteer to continue serving the temple, even after death.
  They would stand inanimate in their alcoves, adorned with gold, representing a rich afterlife, and allow a spell to be placed upon them, focussing their minds on nothing but their mission -- to obtain the glowshrooms.

  When the mushrooms grew fertile, the `golden priests' would use spells to obtain them, and put them in a chest.
  When the goblin mushroom-pickers ascended, the golden priests threw offensive spells down at them, then raised them as ghouls to fight again.

  This battle endured throughout these centuries.
  One priest lost an arm in a battle, another lost a leg, while their army of undead hobgoblins waxed and waned.

  They remain here still, mostly in silence, obtaining mushrooms which then sit in a pile, on top of a chest, rotting.
\end{exampletext}

\mapentry[underGreenTower]{The Stairs}

Years of growth and soil-spillage have left a thin layer of mucus on the stairs.

\paragraph{Anyone descending}
must make a \roll{Dexterity}{Athletics} roll, \tn[8], or fall down one staircase, taking $1D6-2$ Damage.
Characters can get a bonus for proper equipment, such as rope.

The air down in the tomb has become so dry and foetid, that anyone spending time there gains 2~\glspl{fatigue} per \gls{interval}.
Of course, this can be offset with sufficient rest (or just leaving the place to air out for a few days).

The stairs and all hallways here are rather narrow, making weapons difficult to swing.%
\exRef{core}{Core Rules}{enclosedcombat}

\mapentry[underWatcher]{The Watcher}

The tomb is guarded by a Pious Ghast who stands in a side-cupboard, sworn to guard the golden priests.
He has spent a long time down here in the dry air, and his body so seized up that he cannot move.
A little time, however, will allow him to regain the use of his limbs, and open the door.

\paragraph{Opening the door}
requires a \roll{Strength}{Crafts} roll (\tn[14]), as the door is bolted shut from the inside, and will have to be busted in.

\paragraph{If a player insists on `picking the lock'}
(despite the lack of lock) they roll \roll{Intelligence}{Larceny} (\tn[16]).

\begin{boxtext}

  You swing the door open to find a highly decorated corpse with a pendant to \gls{eldren} made of gold, with bone strung along the copper thread.
  The clothes look like they were once silk, and the helmet's leather covering seems to be a human face, stretched out and tanned.

\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} stab the corpse,}
they can kill it\ldots after a few stabs.

\paragraph{If they pass the door,}
the Pious Ghast animates and comes to kill them.%
\footnote{I have seen three groups of players go through this area, observe the corpse, and walk on, leaving him unscathed.}

His use of a shortsword also means he will not gain any penalty from the narrow hallway.

\mapentry[underPriests]{Hall of the Golden Priests}

A long time ago, onlookers came here to gawk at the splendour of a glorious afterlife.
The priests of \gls{eldren} who gained the highest honours of the temple would remain here to guard it forever.
Each is decked in golden jewellery.

\begin{boxtext}

  Five dead men, mummified and covered in golden jewels, stand in each of five enclaves at the side of the room.
  You notice head wounds and missing limbs upon some of the bodies.

  Little spears litter the area, as if a battle has taken place here.

\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{Once the \glspl{pc} enter,}
the demiliches cast hostile spells at them (their presence does not help extracting mushrooms).

\paragraph{Complementing the priests}
breaks the Mind spell, which has them focussed on their single task.
All of them have the code `Noble', so anything which would earn a player \glspl{xp} serves to break this spell.%
\exRef{stories}{Stories}{noble}

After this, the priests will stop attacking, and take some time to re-examine their unlives, and discuss (silently, with the unknowable communications of the undead) what they want to do, if anything.

\mapentry[underDoors]{Dirty Tunnels}

\begin{exampletext}
  These openings once had doors to hide the secret items given to the \gls{healersGuild}, but the doors were destroyed during the centuries of battle.
\end{exampletext}

Strange and rotten spears, made from unknown plant-matter, litter the area, along with rotten mushrooms.
A green glow emanates through the narrow paths.

\mapentry[underSideRoom]{Side Room}

\begin{exampletext}
  The natural tunnel was further excavated in order to horde the priests' treasures.
  The glowshrooms collected filled up the chests, but the priests just kept piling them on top, and ordering their undead hobgoblins to do the same.
\end{exampletext}

At present, this room contains \lootMedium, \lootJewellery, \lootJewellery, \lootJewellery, \lootJewellery, and \lootBig, all held in a small chest at the side of the room, under a massive pile of rotten mushrooms.

The room also contains 14 undead hobgoblins, standing ready to kill any nura who come up from the tunnel, or just anyone who enters.

\undeadhobgoblin[\npc{\T[14]\N\D}{14 Undead Hobgoblins}]

\mapentry[Abyss]{Abyss}

This hole leads down a sharp and muddy incline, some 100 steps below, where hobgoblins listen intently to any noises above.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} dislodge and drop a mushroom,}
they may see shadows moving below, and wonder who lives down there.

\paragraph{If they somehow get down the hole,}
they have entered the goblin realm, and do not speak the language.
They have escaped the mundane gods, and their souls will enter a completely unknown realm as their bodies become a living hobgoblin-feast.

\mapentry[underSpiral]{Downward Spiral}

\begin{exampletext}
  This tunnel swirls round the \nameref{Abyss}, heading down, until it ends in a barred door.
  Opening the door allows an excellent view of the green glowshrooms all around, and provides an excellent vantage point to shoot any hobgoblins which try to climb up.
\end{exampletext}

\paragraph{If any one of the golden priests die,}
the goblins kill the others and break out.
Raise the local goblin rating by 3.%
