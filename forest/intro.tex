\noindent
The forest holds two active \glspl{fiend} who want to eat the outer \glspl{village}.
\Glsfirst{necromancer} leaves his crumbling temple to kill people and grow his undead army.
\Gls{spiderqueen} emerges from her mobile fortress of webs, and wants to feed farmers to her \glspl{crawler} pets.
When \pgls{segment} shows this symbol -- \gls{vlg} -- it means \pgls{village} or \gls{broch} may fall to the forest, and the \gls{edge} advances another step inwards.

And if enough outer \glspl{broch} and \glspl{village} fall, all the \glspl{monster} of the forest will flood into the unprotected, interior farmlands.
\Gls{valley} would then become uninhabitable, and turn into a flood of refugees, all trying to reach some other settlement before \gls{cTwo} brings \glspl{snow}.

Making matters worse, the \glspl{wolfhead} want to poke around the forest in search of ancient alchemical gateways.
They, or the \glspl{pc}, will eventually find the remains of \gls{archwarp} and \gls{sixshadow} from \gls{lostcity}, which bring all new complications.
