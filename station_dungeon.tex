\index{Prison}

\begin{exampletext}
  Some time ago, the guards captured an ogre, and \gls{townmaster} ordered them to keep it alive so he and \gls{alchemist} could better understand it.
  Since then he's forgotten about it, but the guards have to keep feeding it.

  The ogre can't speak the local language, but everyone knows what it wants to say -- `food'.
  Twice a day, they take a cart down the stairs, deal out a small portion to each of the inmates, then place the rest by the great door as a massive, grabbing hand reaches out the shutter and piles the food into its mouth.
\end{exampletext}

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} enter as prisoners,}
they will have to think a lot about how to escape -- this won't be easy!

\paragraph{If anyone tries to pick the locks,}
they will need to craft some make-shift equipment first, and make sure nobody is listening to them.
The roll is \roll{Intelligence}{Larceny}, \tn[12].

Once one lock has been picked, the characters gains a cumulative +1 bonus on every cell in the same row.

\paragraph{Every day,}
the guards give them two small meals and empty their bucket.

The meals are so small that they gain 1 \gls{fatigue}, daily.

\paragraph{On day 2,}
a scout form the \gls{guard} gets thrown in a cell for dereliction of duty (he living with villagers and sending back false reports).

\paragraph{On day 4,}
\gls{beardedalemaster} lands in a cell for insulting \gls{townmaster} during a meeting.
She will stay here only one night.

\mapentry[dunStorage]{Storage}

Every day, the guards take the food cart down to the hall, and unload the contents into this room.

A chest, sealed with an intricate knot, contains good quality wine.
The higher ranking guards leave the wine here, and won't tell Cronsink how to open it.

\paragraph{If any prisoners listen carefully,}
they will hear the bottles being deposited while guards talk about the excellent vintage.

\mapentry[guardStationRoom]{Guard Station}

The \glspl{sunGuard} on \glsentrytext{captain}'s shitlist have to sleep down here.
Another guard stays in the \nameref{mainPrisonRoom}, room~\ref{mainPrisonRoom}, below, so that two remain on shift at all times.

Two keys to the cells (one for the top row of cells, and another for the bottom), hang on the wall, along with another for the ogre (in room~\ref{ogreCell}) and a fourth key for the chest in room~\ref{thingsRoom}.

\mapentry[mainPrisonRoom]{Main Hall}

At least one guard remains here at all times.
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  When Hordcut is on shift, she tells the prisoners to shut up.
  If they don't, she'll open the doors and bash their heads in.
  \item
  When Cronsink comes on shift, he tells prisoners to shut up, or tries to get them to sing with him while he drinks.
  He passes out from drinking too much shortly afterwards.
  \item
  When both are up and awake, they play cards together, and he complains that Hordcut always wins.
\end{itemize}

\mapentry[dunCells]{The Cells}

\paragraph{The top left cell}
houses \gls{warningbard} (assuming somoeone arrested him)%
\footnote{See page \pageref{warningbard}.},
who sits singing to himself.

\paragraph{The bottom right cell contains Ram,}
and if anyone speaks hopefully about escape, he tells them what will go wrong with the plan.

If the \glspl{pc} prove one of his melancholic predictions wrong, he helps them escape.

\mapentry[dunGrate]{The Grate}

Here all the filth and debris collected from the prisons gets thrown in the hole.

\paragraph{Breaking the grate open}
requires a \roll{Strength}{Crafts} roll (\tn[10]).
It leads straight downwards to room~\vref{sewerWaterHall} in \nameref{sewers}.

\mapentry[thingsRoom]{Prisoners' Possessions}

The chest contains any valuable items the prisoners carried which might fit inside the chest.
The key rests in room~\ref{guardStationRoom}.

Their other possessions lie scattered across the room, along with some musical instruments.

\mapentry[ogreCell]{Ogre's Cell}

Here the wretched ogre stays, unable to do more than sing, and eat too seldomly.

\paragraph{If anyone stages a breakout,}
Laban comes with them, but immediately stops to eat anything (or anyone) he can.
Once satiated, he will continue following anyone leading a prison break.
