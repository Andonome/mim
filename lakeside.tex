Lakeside is a small, walled, village near the \gls{edge}, with a large and proud temple to Ohta resting at its side, waiting for battle.

The tall stone walls reach 4 metres into the air.
The bridges are made of wood, and ready to burn at a moment's notice if either side of the village falls to some enemy.
The river running through the centre is not dangerous, but is strong enough to sweep almost anyone away if they try to swim against it.

Lakeside has an unusually large number of well-armed young soldiers, ready to fight for their little patch of the world at a moment's notice.
It is lead by Builder Cronblight of the \gls{guard}, who effectively functions as the \gls{village}'s \gls{warden}.%
\footnote{Most humans would consider this violation of guild separation outrageous, but the \gls{village}'s small size makes for extenuating circumstances.}

The river and lake here provides important trade to the surrounding areas, and has the only source of raw iron to the town, so if the \gls{village} ever perishes, the price of weapons will double.

\paragraph{If you use this area for a ghoul attack with \gls{necromancer},}
the ghouls approach underwater and come up from the river.

\mapentry[lakeSquare]{Central Square}

The town's central square contains a statue of \gls{king} looking lordly.
It was built over a level 2 mana lake, so the entire town will allow a spell-caster to regenerate 1 MP per turn, and anyone closer to the statue will regenerate 2 per turn.

\mapentry[lakeTemple]{Ohta's House}

The miniature citadel houses over 1,000 swords, 2,000 shields, and 20,000 arrows, ready for sale.
The \glspl{pc} can buy just about any weapon they can name here, all for the basic prices in the core rules.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} are looking to hire a soldier,}
they will find capable people here.

\mapentry[lakeDocks]{Docks}

Here, boats from \gls{southDale} enter, carrying dwarvish spirits.
