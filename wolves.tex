\sidequest[Town,Villages,Forest]{Wolf Heads}

\noindent
The characters hear of a guild crew travelling around, and eventually meet them.
This Side Quest is designed to run in the background, and flavour other encounters.

\Gls{beardedalemaster} gets into other shenanigans later, in \nameref{troubleAle}, page \pageref{troubleAle}.

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{\N \squash Rumours of Glory}% NAME
{The party hear about famous warriors in their area}% SUMMARY

The local gossip relates to how the local heroes, known as the \textit{Wolf Heads}, recently protected a town from a goblin invasion.
They act like the adventurers of old, but officially take their orders from the Ale Guild of the Shale, through \gls{beardedalemaster}.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item{There were around forty goblins.}
  \item{The Wolf Heads stopped them with grease spells over the walls, so the goblins could not climb properly, leaving the archers time to pick off more.}
  \item{The local village master refused to pay for goblin heads taken, claiming it would be illegal as it would count as him raising his own army.}
  \item{The party refused to gather payment from the local peasants, but have sworn a blood oath to kill Village Master Solus.}
\end{enumerate}

This last rumour isn't entirely accurate -- the Wolf Heads are irritated with Village Master Solus (see page \pageref{solus}), but have not sworn an oath to kill him.

Play this encounter at the same time as the next Side Quest part, and raise the local nura rating by 1.

\sqpart{Villages}% AREA
{Arm Wrestling}% NAME
{The characters meet the Wolf Heads}% SUMMARY
\label{wolfHeads}

The Wolf Heads have just encountered ten chitincrawlers, and slew the lot.
They used a giant web spell, along with a lot of arrows.

They are tired, but unwounded, and are up for fun, so they went to a nearby village to drink.
Wherever the characters are, they encounter the Wolf Heads, who then challenge them to arm-wrestling contests, or magical contests.
The Wolf Heads will also speak about encountering goblins, both during the recent assault on a village, and in general.
The games are mostly in good faith, but if the party have any obviously valuable items, Jubilee will attempt to steal it from them.

she denies everything, while grinning like a kid who ate all the chocolates.

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{\N \squash Rumours of Ogres}% NAME
{The party hear more of the Wolf Heads}% SUMMARY

The characters hear more of the wolf heads, specifically about how they are looking for some abandoned temple to Qualm\"e, which could be the source of so many goblins in the area.
The locals generally believe the Wolf Heads will save them all.

Play this encounter at the same time as the next Side Quest on your list.

\sqpart{Forest}% AREA
{\squash Helping Hands}% NAME
{The party encounter the Wolf Heads again, who lend a hand}% SUMMARY

The wolf heads come across the party at the same time as another encounter.
If the party are in trouble, they come to save them.
If the party aren't, they may just walk together with them for safety.

\sqpart{Villages}% AREA
{A Cry for Help}% NAME
{The party find the Wolf Heads attacked by ogres}% SUMMARY

A dozen ogres ambushed the Wolf Heads on the road, and the party heard their cries in the distance.
By the time the party arrive (assuming they come towards the cries) Bertold is unconscious (-3 HP), and Jubilee is nearly dead (2 HP left).

Ten ogres remain alive.
Five are focussed on the remaining Wolf Heads, and the other five have decided to wait in the bushes to ambush the party (or if not the bushes, inside nearby houses, or anywhere appropriate).

\paragraph{\N If the party leave}
then the Wolf Heads die (raise the local Nura rating by 1 as the Wolf Heads can no longer help).
If the Wolf Heads survive, they will rest in \gls{town}, and be ready for any call to adventure, such as joining the fight against the nura in the future.

\paragraph{If the party rescue the Wolf Heads,}
then the Wolf Heads can tell them about \gls{banditking}'s plan to create a blight, cutting Maitavale off from the rest of the kingdom.%
\footnote{See \autopageref{blightConspiracy}.}
They overheard the plan while stalking the Immortal Bandits.
They do not know where this portal exists, only that the bandits suspect it exists.
