\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{Pickpocketed}% NAME
{Someone has stolen one of the characters' items}% SUMMARY

The player with the highest Intelligence Bonus makes a \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} roll (\tn[9]).
Failure indicates a thief has stolen the last item on the player's character sheet, and successfully fled.

\begin{boxtext}

  You feel the side of your leg and suddenly your heart stops.
  You wonder where is\ldots \textit{which item is the last one written on your character sheet?}

\end{boxtext}

It might be possible to track the thief, down with enough time spent investigating, but it'll require an \roll{Intelligence}{Vigilance} roll at \tn[13].

Fenslick, a local pickpocket, has no excuse except for his young age, and bad luck in life, though he's 25 and was recently kicked out of an apprenticeship for drinking too heavily on the job.

If the players decide to turn him in, he will be pulled up about previous crimes at the same time, and hanged by the end of the week.
With the right deal, he might agree to accompany them on a dangerous mission instead of swinging in the \gls{court}.

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{The Fat, Black Cat}% NAME
{He simply wants some fish}% SUMMARY

A horrifying scream rings out in the middle of the street.
When the \glspl{pc} look about, they find a fat, black cat looking at them intently.

If they move away, he follows (for at least \pgls{interval}), and if they move towards him, he run away, but looks back to check they're following him.

\paragraph{If the troupe follow,}
they end up at the local fishmongers.
The cat then stands beside the stall and yells at them.
If he gets fish, he simply leaves for the \gls{paperGuild}.

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{Pickpocketed Again!}% NAME
{Someone else picks a character's pocket}% SUMMARY

The player with the highest Academics Skill rolls \roll{Wits}{Vigilance}, \tn[8].

\begin{boxtext}
  You feel your trouser leg, and suddenly think ``Oh, not again!''.  \textit{What's the last item written on your character sheet?}
\end{boxtext}

\humanthief[\NPC{\F\Hu}{Gabile}{beady eyes}{messes up her hair}{to join a guild}]

This time it's a young woman, down on her luck as her family farm was consumed entirely by nura.
The rest have died, and she's now alone.

\paragraph{If caught,}
Gabile apologizes profusely, and explains her situation.
