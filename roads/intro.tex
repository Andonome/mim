Most \glspl{village} and hamlets on the map (\autopageref{Irina/greylands}) have no name in this book; keeping track of so many inconsequential locations would just be a pain.
Instead, you should name these locations as they come up, and keep track of any which the players respond to.

Here are a few example names:

\begin{description}
	\item[Liskill]
  where a farmboy killed \pgls{basilisk} with one arrow.
  \index{Liskill}
	\item[Twolisk]
  where a farmboy killed two \glspl{basilisk} with two rocks.
  \index{Twolisk}
	\item[Newarp]
  where people from \gls{archwarp} resettled after it fell, over two centuries ago.
  \index{Newarp}
	\item[Talltail]
  where tall grass grows.
	\item[Fortibane]

	\item[Artcull]
