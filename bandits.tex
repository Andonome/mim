\sidequest[Roads,Forest]{Entitlement}

\noindent
The \gls{whiteplains} \glspl{warden} cannot survive the tax hikes imposed on them when taking their boats through \gls{town}, so they have sent two of their most devious agitators to stir up trouble.
They begin by making close alliances, and giving lofty promises to the local \gls{guard}, then bandits.

Throughout this story, they try to slowly replace or destroy existing power structures, and to make an alliance with the \glspl{pc}.

{Rotten Breath}% NAME
{\Glsentrytext{traitor} sends the party to find a cure for his breath}% SUMMARY
\label{rottenBreath}

\begin{exampletext}
  When \pgls{guard} Rider reported finding a ruined temple%
  \footnote{See \vpageref{necromancers_lair}.}
  to \gls{traitor}, \gls{traitor} went to investigate with \gls{sewerking}.
  At first, it appeared abandoned, so \gls{sewerking} picked up some interesting items he found in the hall.

  A moment later, a swarm of stirges swarmed around \gls{traitor}, and their bite carried an infection.
  \Gls{traitor} now has \textit{Breath Rot}.
  The two fled, carrying statues and a magical \gls{artefact}%
  \footnote{See \vpageref{The Bladder Skull}.}
  but \gls{traitor} still has foul breath from a disease which can slowly suffocate people to death.
\end{exampletext}

\noindent
The \gls{jotter} awakens the troupe rudely, and gives them a foul lecture, with stinking breath.
He needs them to march, as fast as they can, and go to a spot past the \gls{edge} where Screeching Moss%
\exRef{judgement}{Judgement}{screeching_moss}
grows.
Screech Moss is the only thing \gls{traitor} knows about which can cure his disease.

How far the \glspl{pc} must march depends on where they start, and how well they can navigate,%
\exRef{core}{Core Rules}{navigate_land}
but the moss should be somewhere close.

\paragraph{If the troupe fetch the moss within a couple of days,}
\gls{traitor} rewards them with a longsword each, then asks them to go immediately to \gls{town} to request \gls{forestpriest} create a cure for him, and gives them a single note stating they have official business.%
\footnote{The \gls{guard} should not usually enter towns without official business.}

\paragraph{If the troupe enter \gls{town},}
they will find \gls{forestpriest} in the \gls{doulaShop}, not far from \gls{pig}.

\paragraph{If the troupe fail to make it back within a couple of days,}
\gls{traitor} will be furious with them, but will find another group of \glspl{guard} to bring him a cure.

\begin{boxtext}
  Creeping closer to the light, you spot glimpses of the tip of a fire, then a second not far ahead, but no voice, or any movement.
  You find it impossible to move without making constant crunching and grating sounds.

{Guild Consciousness}% NAME
{\gls{sewerthief} talks politics}% SUMMARY

\Gls{sewerthief} wants a promotion, so he has taken on the dangerous mission of tracking down a griffin eyrie.
To survive the night, he lights two fires, fairly far apart, then crawls under a little bush to hide.
His hope is that any predators in the area will wander up to the fire, and not him.

\sewerthief

\Gls{sewerthief} speaks to the troupe about \gls{lostcity}, then soon after -- politics.

\begin{speechtext}
  ``They say all of \gls{valley} used to be one big city, and you could just walk anywhere.
  Just think about how wonderful it must be if all of this were a big city, with gardens, just like \glspl{warden} have, and we weren't sitting in the dark, away from the fires.

  You know they say we can become \glspl{warden} by building a new \gls{village}, but I've never really seen it.
  We don't become \glspl{warden} really, and none of the \glspl{warden} I've seen ever started in the \gls{guard}.''
\end{speechtext}

{New Kids}% NAME
{The \glsentrytext{whiteBandits} have an argument with the \glsentrytext{guard}}% SUMMARY

\ifnum\value{temperature}=0
  \newcommand\localMonster{griffins}
\else
  \newcommand\localMonster{a basilisk}
\fi

\begin{exampletext}
  \Gls{banditking} tours around \gls{valley} with a dozen men, trying to ingratiate himself to as many \glspl{warden} as he can.
  He presents the entourage as his \glspl{sunGuard}, but in reality, each of them once worked as bandits, or as the gutter-scum of \gls{town}.

  When a traveller informed him that \localMonster\ had attacked \pgls{village} for the last few nights, he marched hard with his entourage to help.
  Within the day, they arrived, and stayed the night.
  Once it attacked, they loosed arrows at it, then followed the trail of blood towards \gls{town}.

  Shortly after, the local \gls{guard} arrived, and began their own volley of arrows.
\end{exampletext}

The \glspl{pc} arrive to find \localMonster, full arrows, at least one of which came from the \gls{guard}.
Both groups want the corpse, which could fetch a good sum of money.

Sorting the disagreement won't be easy.
The exact roll depends on what the \glspl{pc} attempt.
They might try to threaten one group with \roll{Strength}{Tactics}, or calm the situation with \roll{Charisma}{Empathy}.

\paragraph{If the encounter occurs far from \gls{town},}
the meat will soon spoil anyway, so resolving the disagreement requires a roll at \tn[9].

If this part occurs closer to \gls{town} (or even a large \gls{village}), the rolls will be at \tn[12].

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} cannot resolve the situation within two rolls,}
the two groups begin to fight.

Remember to roll only for skirmishes the \glspl{pc} have engaged in, and use the simplified combat rules for \glspl{npc} at the end of each round.%
\exRef{judgement}{Judgement}{npcfights}

\banditking

\paragraph{However this resolves,}
\gls{banditking} will focus on his own safety above all else, even if it means running away, with any surviving men.
