\begin{exampletext}
  Some centuries past, in the time of \gls{lostcity}, a temple of \gls{eldren} stood here, and dug down into the depths to find places to store the heaps of donations people gave them.
  The diggers soon stumbled into a cave-shaft, going straight down, where little glowing mushrooms glowed green.%
  \exRef{judgement}{Judgement}{glowshroom}

  These `glowshrooms' serve as Fire \glspl{ingredient}, so the \glspl{helper} started `fishing' for them, with little fishing hooks.

  When little goblins poked their heads out from below, the situation could only go one way\ldots
\end{exampletext}

The \gls{healersGuild} crumbled, along with the rest of the town.
The population left their houses for the forest to consume, and eventually forgot the town's name.

Now the \glspl{wolfhead} have commissioned a secret \gls{bothy}, both as a base of operations, and a half-way house between them and where they think they can find one of the gateways of \gls{lostcity}.

\mapentry[greenGrounds]{Outer Grounds}

The area around the tower contains piles of rock which labourers have collected from the surrounding ruins.

\paragraph{If anyone detects source of mana,}
they notice something in the area, but will have trouble pinpointing it without triangulation.
The little trickle in fact comes from a small opening to the abandoned basement (area \ref{underGreenTower} on the map).

The rock has a \gls{weight} of 12.

\paragraph{The masons}
work outside during the day, and will almost certainly notice the \glspl{pc} walking towards them, from the forest.
And with no roads in, they will feel immediate suspicion.
Seeing \gls{guard} uniforms will only deepen their worries.

Unless the \glspl{pc} give them a reason not to, they masons will act friendly, offer them a drink on the top floor (area \ref{greenTop}), lock the trapdoor from below, and leave them to the wind and the griffins.%

\mapentry[greenConservatory]{Conservatory}

Overnight, the labouring equipment rests here.
The lock is a simple knot tied on the inside.
Getting in is easy -- \roll{Intelligence}{Larceny} (\tn[6]) to slide a knife through a crack and cut the rope.
Getting in undetected requires more thinking -- \roll{Intelligence}{Larceny} (\tn[14]) to thread a series of strings through, and create the leverage to undo the knot.

\mapentry[green1]{First Floor}

Basic straw-stuffed beds, clothes, and 10 longbows lie here (+2 Damage).

\mapentry[green2]{Second Floor}

The men sleep here, though it's eventually planned as a station for lower-level archers.

\mapentry[green3]{Third Floor}

The top floor provides a place for \gls{southSeeker}, overseer of the operation, to get a good look at the surrounding area.
This is also where he keeps a stockpile of weapons:

\begin{description}
  \item[Wall Rack]
  with
  20 longbows
  \item[Leather bundles]
  with
  50 longswords
  \item[Wooden Chest 1]
  with
  50 suits of partial leather armour
  \item[Wooden Chest 2]
  with
  50 suits of partial chain armour
  \item[Small Chest]
  contains:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    Fire \gls{boon}
    \item
    Air \gls{boon}
    \item
    Earth \gls{boon}
    \item
    \lootMagic
  \end{itemize}
\end{description}

\addtocounter{treasure}{-1}
\Gls{southSeeker} purchased the \lootMagic\ some years ago, and left it here to ensure none of the \gls{sunGuard} would search him in \gls{town}, and take it from him.

\showTalisman

\mapentry[greenTop]{Top Floor}

This green roof meshes with the local trees for some distance around, but like any other camouflage, it seems obvious once you look at it.

From the top of the roof, anyone can see for miles around.
They can't see people or creatures sneaking about, but they can see basilisks and groups of men without fail, even by moonlight.

\mapentry[underGreenTower]{The Stairs}

Years of growth and soil-spillage have left a thin layer of mucus on the stairs.

\paragraph{Anyone descending}
must make a \roll{Dexterity}{Athletics} roll, \tn[8], or fall down one staircase, taking $1D6-2$ Damage.
Characters can get a bonus for proper equipment, such as rope.

The air down in the tomb has become so dry and foetid, that anyone spending time there gains 2~\glspl{fatigue} per \gls{interval}.
Of course, this can be offset with sufficient rest (or just leaving the place to air out for a few days).

The stairs and all hallways here are rather narrow, making weapons difficult to swing.%
\exRef{core}{Core Rules}{enclosedcombat}

\mapentry[underWatcher]{The Watcher}

The tomb is guarded by a Pious Ghast who stands in a side-cupboard, sworn to guard the golden priests.
He has spent a long time down here in the dry air, and his body so seized up that he cannot move.
A little time, however, will allow him to regain the use of his limbs, and open the door.

\paragraph{Opening the door}
requires a Strength + Crafts roll at TN 14, as the door is bolted shut from the inside, and will have to be busted in.

\paragraph{If a player insists on `picking the lock'}
(despite the lack of lock) they roll Intelligence + Larceny, TN 16.

\begin{boxtext}

  You swing the door open to find a highly decorated corpse with a pendant to Eldren made of gold, with bone strung along the copper thread.
  The clothes look like they were once silk, and the helmet's leather covering seems to be a human face, stretched out and tanned.

\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} stab the corpse,}
they can kill it.

\paragraph{If they pass the door,}
the Pious Ghast animates and comes to kill them.
He is intelligent enough to know to sneak.
His use of a shortsword also means he will not gain any penalty from the narrow hallway.

If the characters enter with the Torpor spell cast, or rings of asphyxiation, they will be able to pass the Pious Ghast and the Golden Priests invisibly, so long as they do not linger too close to any of them.

\mapentry[underPriests]{Hall of the Golden Priests}

\textbf{Background:}
A long time ago, onlookers came here to gawk at the splendour of a glorious afterlife.
The priests of Eldren who gained the highest honours of the temple would remain here to guard it forever.
Each is decked in golden jewellery.

\begin{boxtext}

  Five dead men, mummified and covered in golden jewels, stand in each of five enclaves at the side of the room.
  You notice head wounds and missing limbs upon some of the bodies.

  Little spears litter the area, as if a battle has taken place here.

\end{boxtext}

\demilich[\npc{\D\F}{Demilich Tamar}]

\paragraph{Once the \glspl{pc} enter,}
the demiliches cast hostile spells at them.

\mapentry[underDoors]{Exposed Doors}

\textbf{Background:}
These openings once had doors to hide the secret items of the Temple of Hate, but the doors have since shattered and broken from centuries of warfare.
Primitive spears litter the area.

\mapentry[underSideRoom]{Side Room}

\textbf{Background:}
The natural tunnel was further excavated in order to horde the priests' treasures.
At present, this room contains \lootMedium, \lootBig, and \lootMagic, all held in a small chest at the side of the room.

The room also contains 14 undead hobgoblins, standing ready to kill any nura who come up from the tunnel, or just anyone who enters.

\undeadhobgoblin[\npc{\T[14]\N\D}{14 Undead Hobgoblins}]

\mapentry[underSpiral]{Downward Spiral}

\paragraph{If the troupe venture down the hallway,}
they find four more undead hobgoblins in the tunnel.
Their job is to open the door and jump on any nura climbing up, but they will attack anyone on sight.

\undeadhobgoblin[\npc{\T\N\D}{4 Undead Hobgoblins}]

\begin{exampletext}

  Throughout the long years, the golden priests directed the stupid undead to dig and dig into the hillside.
  They looped round, and dug into the tunnel, then fashioned a door from the broken wood from previous battles.

Any nura digging upwards can now be attacked by the undead, who hurl themselves down to attach anything climbing up, before one of the golden priests shut the door again.
While several nura would normally burst through any door, opening a stuck door while climbing can be almost impossible.

\end{exampletext}

\mapentry[Abyss]{Abyss}

Characters entering this area feel a warm breeze coming from the abyss, and intense magical energies.
The abyss itself is a third-level mana lake, constantly radiating magical energy.
%! Mana lakes?

\paragraph{If they somehow get down the hole,}
they will find a skull embedded in the wall -- the head of a devout warrior.
His head -- carved with the story of his victories -- functions as a permanently-open magical doorway.

%! Removed The Portal Summoner

\paragraph{Destroying the Portal Summoner}
is easy if one can get close enough.
However, getting close to it will almost certainly alert the nura below, in their citadel.
At this point, heavily armoured hobgoblins will attempt to climb up to stop the vandalism.

\hobgoblin

\begin{exampletext}

  The priests of the \gls{armourHall}, who opened the door to the Goblin Realm, were not stupid.
 They created the door through a magical artefact and placed that artefact down a deep chasm, so they could better defend their location in case of attack.
  What they had not counted on was the sheer number of nura who could climb up from below.
  They clamoured up in their hundreds, with spiked gloves to climb more easily up the soft cavernous walls.

  When the nura turned against the city, the two portals spewed hobgoblins, ogres, and the like, at the same time.
  The priests argued, and considered caving the entire temple in.
  They prayed to Hate, and saw a vision of the temple's destruction, with a hole which sucked in more and more earth, getting wider and wider, until nura filled the land.

  At this point, the priests of Eldren decided to take over, and remain, guarding the temple forever.
  They had their servants wrap them in cloth while warriors fought against the nura.
  They each took vows to never eat, open their eyes, or listen to music again.
  All five became demiliches, sworn to serve their temple forever.

  As the nura came up, the golden priests killed them with magic, then raised the bodies from the dead to fight against more nura.
  This has left the situation in a stalemate.
  Nura come up from the tunnel, they die, the golden priests raise them as ghouls to fight until all nura lie dead.
  This repeats every few years.

  So far, two of the golden priests have met their final end.
  Their remains have been placed back in their chambers by the others.

  Throughout these centuries, barely a dozen goblins have managed to escape and get into the lands above, and almost all died of starvation before finding anywhere above.

\end{exampletext}

\paragraph{If the troupe attempt to understand this area,}
they will no doubt find it confusing -- as well they should.
They will not find communication with the gold priests easy.
However, the demiliches are willing to communicate, and one can send telepathic thoughts with the Enchantment sphere.

\paragraph{If two of the golden priests die,}
the nura kill the other and break out.
Raise the local nura rating by 3.
