\textbf{Background:}
\gls{nurabaron} always enjoyed hosting \gls{townmaster}, and wholeheartedly agreed that local town masters should have their own armies, rather than relying on the \gls{guard}.
He has more men-at-arms than the law allows, but not by much, and he wants more, both for his own protection, and so he has more people to order about.
For many seasons, he has worked with \gls{townmaster} to transport food to the woodspy bandits.

Trouble struck a couple of days ago%
\footnote{Or whenever you start this Side Quest.}
when \gls{sewerking}'s Immortal Bandits followed a trader, and found out about food being dropped in \gls{redfall} for the Woodspy Bandits.
\Gls{sewerking} visited \gls{nurabaron}, pretending to be a wandering (and illegal) alchemist, and `gifted' him ogre dust, claiming it would make anyone who breathed it in into an unstoppable warrior.
\Gls{nurabaron} has little idea about how the nura work, so he tried the powder himself, and became a massive, hulking brute, with an insatiable appetite.

While \gls{sewerking} thought that would finish him, \gls{nurabaron} had plenty of food to hand, so despite his sudden loss in intelligence, he continued being a village master.
His men felt distressed, but they all knew that if they lost their jobs, they would have to work outside of their comfortable keep, beyond the \glsentrytext{edge}.

Since then, \gls{sewerking}'s advisor and seneschal, Thorn, has kept the keep running mostly as usual.
\Gls{nurabaron} insisted on having his family join him, so they have all gorged themselves on food every night.

Taxes raised, the village's food disappeared (along with any shipments intended for the Woodspy Bandits), and the keep's servants have become steadily more distressed at their master's erratic, ridiculous, and aggressive behaviour.

As a result of starvation, many of the local peasants have turned to banditry.

\sqpart{Villages}% AREA
{\N Bad Bandits}% NAME
{Villagers from Redfall are so hungry they have turned to banditry, but they're not very good at it}% SUMMARY

Foxmoss is healthy enough, but the rest of his crew of eight men look nearly emaciated.
They demand silver, or at least copper, but then quickly settle for any rations the characters might have.

\begin{boxtext}

  A single arrow hits the road ten feet in front of you with a dull thud.
  A man stands up from the bushes nearby saying ``Stand forth, and deliver!''.

\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If the characters refuse,}
the bandits might shoot, but they're easily intimidated.  If the characters attack, the bandits flee.

Of course, these aren't proper bandits.
This is the first robbery they've attempted.
If pushed, they explain that they're really farmers in the nearby village \gls{redfall}, and the local sheriff's been demanding steadily more and more meat and grain as taxes.
They don't have the strength to go on.

\paragraph{If the characters investigate further,}
they may well end up at Redfall Keep.
In that case, have them stopped at the gate, and play out the encounter below with Thorn the Diplomat.
He won't let them in the keep, but he will promise all he can if the characters complete the mission he has for them.

Wherever the party have encountered these bandits, \gls{redfall} Keep is nearby, so if you want to pen a map as you go, at it here.

{\N Wrong Direction Chickens}% NAME
{A tradesman is taking chickens \emph{from} town to \glsentrytext{redfall}}% SUMMARY

\Gls{redfall} needs a lot of food to keep \gls{nurabaron}'s family fed, so they have started ordering more food.
Normally, villages feed the towns, but in this case the town is feeding the village.

\begin{boxtext}

  The road is speckled with light rain, and you pass by various traders en route.
  All of them are coming from town, so most trundle by with empty wagons, though one has a full cart of chickens in cages.
  The rain lets off just as the Sun sets, leaving everyone damp.

\end{boxtext}

Slip in the fact that a trader is travelling with chickens away from \gls{town} casually.
If the party notice, they can ask, and he'll tell them he's going to \gls{redfall} because he was paid a lot to do so.
Otherwise, just leave the clue dangling.

{The Search for \Glsentrytext{forestpriest}}% NAME
{\Glsentrytext{nurabaron}'s diplomat asks the party to help him}% SUMMARY
\label{nonstarter}

\stopcontents[Town]

\begin{boxtext}

  A man wearing a fine, purple gown has been watching you from the side of the tavern for some time.

\end{boxtext}

Once approached, he explains (or if not approached, he approaches the PCs).

\begin{speechtext}

  You look like a capable bunch.
  I come with a mission from my lord, who shall remain nameless.
  A terrible curse has been cast on him, and he needs the services of \gls{forestpriest} to remove the curse.

  My patron will pay you a total sum of two hundred gold pieces in return for taking that priest, by any means necessary, to his castle.
  Once he is with you, return post-haste, and ask for me.
  I will then bring you to my master's manse.

\end{speechtext}

\Gls{forestpriest} has gone on a personal pilgrimage some time ago, so finding him will prove a challenge.

\paragraph{If the characters ask around,}
have them roll Charisma + Vigilance, TN 12.
Success means they have found someone who can tell them that \gls{warningbard} knows him well.

If \gls{warningbard} has not yet gone to jail,%
\footnote{See page \pageref{warningbard}.}
he will be found singing to earn his keep around various villages.

They might also discover his whereabouts through Courtbile of the Wolf Heads, as he once let the secret slip to her while drunk.%
\footnote{See page \pageref{courtbile}.}

\paragraph{If the PCs find \gls{forestpriest},}
he cannot actually `cast magic' and cure \gls{nurabaron}, because nura can only be cured through starvation.
However, he still has a plan -- he will turn \gls{nurabaron} (and possibly his family) into bears, and then have them hibernate.
If the season is not right for hibernation, he can use a frost spell to make a cold room.
Once a season has passed, the curse will be cured.

{\N \N\ The Master's Bounty}% NAME
{\Glsentrytext{nurabaron} has been found out, and everyone in \glsfmttext{town} wants the bounty on his head}% SUMMARY
\label{mastersBounty}

A guard at \gls{redfall} has fled, and informed the whole town that \gls{nurabaron} has turned into an ogre.

\begin{speechtext}

    Hear ye! Hear ye!

    Oi! I said ``Bloody well listen!''

    The current price of dwarvish coin is to be lowered by a tenth of the current value.

    Guards are no longer allowed to urinate\ldots in public.
    Guards caught urinating in public, may be reported, to the local {\footnotesize guard station}.

    Honest work is to be found digging fortifications in the Wetlaw village.

    It can wait till I'm bloody-well finished, Murkrash.
    Shut it!

    Listen good to this one!

    \gls{nurabaron} of \gls{redfall} Keep has turned-evil, become-a-depraved-monster, and is to be \underline{\large killed on site}.
    His last known whereabouts is his own keep.
    Within this establishment, his own staff may be \emph{killed} on the basis that they harbour a criminal.
    All goods found therein are considered legal property by the finder.

\end{speechtext}

Arkblow the crier knows nothing more than he's said.  A number of townsfolk quickly decide to take up arms and slay the local monster, hoping the ransack his house and loot anything of value.

Of course, the only way to put a stop to this is for the characters to find \gls{forestpriest} and bring him to the keep before the angry mob arrive, convince the mob that they have already cured \gls{nurabaron}, or somehow rush \gls{nurabaron} to safety.

\paragraph{Stalling the impending trouble}
before it starts could involve extolling laws (Charisma + Academics), pleading (Charisma + Empathy), or anything else.
However they approach the problem, the TN is 12, but they should get at least three rolls before the townsfolk stop listening.

\paragraph{Journeying to \gls{redfall} before the crowd}
won't be a problem if they have horses.
If no horses are present, a few traders will arrive before them, at the very least.

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{The Nura Fort}% NAME
{Redfall becomes a nura fortress}% SUMMARY

If any nura remain alive in Redfall, it becomes a bastion for the nura, and the PCs hear all about what happened in \gls{town}.

If farmers and townsfolk stormed the keep, they tore it apart to gain entry, and the nura inside pulled off bricks to hurl down on their heads.
\Gls{nurabaron} then turned any remaining servants into more nura, with his supply of ogre dust.

What the villagers don't know is that a nuramancer has arrived as the baron's advisor.

See \autopageref{redfallFallen}.
