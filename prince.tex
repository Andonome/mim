\sidequest[Villages]{The Little Prince}\label{littleprince}

\noindent
An elf is assaulted by bandits.
If the characters help, they receive help in return later.
If they join the bandits and rob the elf, other elves will have their vengeance later.

{The Woodspy Bandits are attacking a rich elf}% SUMMARY

\begin{boxtext}
  A voice in the distant forest cries out.
  \begin{quote}
    I'll summon griffins to pull your stomach out!  I'll enchant you to make you eat until your stomach explodes!
  \end{quote}

  A gruff voice laughs nearby.

    ``If you could, you'd have done it already.  And that's some pretty jewels you got there.  Rich ladies like elf jewels.''

\elfprince

If saved, \gls{elfprince} will promise to repay the characters sometime, but immediately leaves.
If the elf dies, the party notice a magpie eyeing them (it will later relay the information to other elves).

\sqpart{Villages}% AREA
{\squash Karma}% NAME
{Three elves return to repay the characters for their previous actions}% SUMMARY

Play this encounter at the same time as the next Side Quest.
The prince's friends journey towards the sea, and they have heard of the characters.
If they aided \gls{elfprince} before, the troop will aid them in return.
If the characters harmed \gls{elfprince}, the elven troop will have heard of it from the bandits, or through a sentient bird.

The elves will not approach at first, but attempt to sneak and observe the party for a while.

\paragraph{If the elves want to hurt the PCs,}
they use their highest level spheres, hopefully while the PCs have already entered combat with someone.

\paragraph{If the elves want to help the PCs,}
they either aid in a battle, or offer a single favour.
The PCs must ask for the favour immediately, or they will never see the elves again.

\elf[\NPC{\M\El}{Sindon}{Lively}{Strokes blonde hair}{Experience}]

\paragraph{If the PCs ask about the bandits,}
Sindon can give them an approximate idea of where the immortal bandits are, as long as they can understand his references (he does not direct them according to which road and \glspl{village} are near, but by river-currents and tree-types).
Understanding him requires Intelligence + Wyldcrafting, TN 10.

\elf[\NPC{\F}{Vanwe}{Dour}{Wipes eyes}{Experience}]

Vanwe was in love with \gls{elfprince}, and plans to either aid the characters well, or \emph{really} hurt them, depending upon their previous actions.

\elf[\NPC{\M}{Neuror}{Jovial}{Spits}{Tribe}]
\label{neuror}

\paragraph{If the PCs ask about \gls{lostcity},}
Neuror begins a repetitive rant about how it was all the humans fault for messing with nura magic, although he doesn't really know many details.
