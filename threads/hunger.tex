\histEvent{\expandafter\theage}{\expandafter\thetrack}{\Glsfmttext{banditking} turns the \glsfmttext{redfall} family into monsters}

\begin{exampletext}
  \noindent
  Last \showCycle[\thetrack],
  \gls{banditking} approached \gls{hungrywarden} and asked if he was one of `the good \glspl{warden}, or the bad ones'.
  \Gls{hungrywarden} did not appreciate the question, they began to fight, and \gls{banditking} cursed the entire \gls{redfall} family with a monstrous face and eternal appetite.

  The curse was a real problem for the staff at \gls{redfall} keep, because if anyone killed their employer, they would lose their positions, and might have to become farmers, or \glspl{guard}.
  So they decided to keep the situation quiet, and keep their \gls{warden} well fed.
  So every day, \gls{hungrywarden} and his wife Carnfin, and their `little' child eat a complete feast then demand another.
\end{exampletext}

Each \gls{segment} provides an echo of the trouble in \gls{redfall}, until the \glspl{pc} intervene, or the place falls apart.

\segment{Roads}% AREA
{Wrong Direction Chickens}% NAME
{The \glsentrytext{redfall} \glsfmtplural{warden} eat so much that they import chickens \emph{from} \glsentrytext{town}}% SUMMARY

\begin{boxtext}
  Light rain speckles the road, traders pass.
  All of them come from \gls{town}, so most trundle by with empty wagons, though one has a full cart of chickens in cages.
  The rain lets off just as the Sun sets, leaving everyone damp.
\end{boxtext}

Food normally goes from hamlets and \glspl{village} to town, but \gls{redfall} imports food.
If the \glspl{pc} as, trader \composeHumanName\ happily tells them that \gls{redfall} pays well for food, but can't say why.

\segment[\squash]{town}% AREA
{The \Glsfmttext{warden}'s New Mail}% NAME
{\Glsfmttext{redseneschal} has to buy \glsfmttext{hungrywarden} unusually large armour}% SUMMARY
\label{mastersMail}

The troupe overhear \composeHumanName, \pgls{armourer}, grumbling about his strange commission --- to make chainmail armour for a man the size of a horse.
They may hear him grumbling in \gls{pig}, or if they go to buy armour, they might witness \gls{redseneschal} requesting the unusual sale (find his \gls{statblock} \vpageref{thorn}).

\segment{Roads}% AREA
{Bad Bandits}% NAME
{Starvation drives \glsfmttext{redfall} farmers to banditry and they attempt to rob the troupe}% SUMMARY

\begin{boxtext}
  A single arrow hits the road ten feet in front of you with a dull thud.
  An emaciated man stands up from the bushes nearby saying ``stand forth, and deliver!''.
\end{boxtext}

\Gls{redfall}'s starving inhabitants have taken to banditry, though they don't have the experience or the strength to do it properly.
They demand silver, or at least copper, but then quickly settle for any \glspl{ration} the characters might have.

\paragraph{If the characters refuse,}
the bandits might shoot, but they're easily intimidated.
If the characters attack, the bandits flee.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} investigate further,}
they may well end up at \gls{redfall} Keep.
In that case, \gls{redseneschal} will ask for their help, as per \gls{segment} number \vref{nonstarter}.

\segment{Roads}% AREA
{The Search for \Glsentrytext{forestpriest}}% NAME
{\Glsentrytext{hungrywarden}'s \Glsentrytext{seneschal} asks the \glsfmtplural{pc} to find \glsfmttext{forestpriest} for secret mission}% SUMMARY
\label{nonstarter}

\Gls{redseneschal} sees the troupe on the road while travelling with a caravan, and asks them to deliver a letter to \gls{forestpriest}, in \gls{town} urgently.%
\footnote{He has to hurry back, to make sure \gls{hungrywarden} stops talking about the possibility of eating farmers in front of his impressionable child.}
He pays them 5~\glspl{sp} upfront, and tells them they will receive 10 more if they deliver it successfully, and accompany her.

He refuses to give his name.
The sealed letter%
\exRef{core}{Core Rules}{letter_sealing}
reads as follows:

%!\null
\begin{speechtext}
  Renowned \pgls{forestpriest},

  I respectfully request your expedient services at \gls{redfall} estate.
  Some dark curse has transformed the family and one horse into ravenous beasts.
  We can pay whatever remains in the power of this diminished estate for your herbal cures.

  The family must be harmed \underline{in no way}.
\end{speechtext}

\thornSeneschal

\label{thorn}

\paragraph{If the troupe go to \gls{town},}
run the first available \gls{segment} as usual (because plans never go smoothly) but remember that \emph{this} \gls{segment} does not end until the troupe complete \gls{redseneschal}'s mission, or abandon it.

\paragraph{Once in \gls{town},}
the troupe find \pgls{forestpriest} in her shop (\vpageref{greyDoulaShop}), ready to leave on a journey (her tea-leaves told her about a journey, but she doesn't know where she's going).
She has a lot of spare \glspl{ration} for the road.

\paragraph{Once at \gls{redfall} with \gls{forestpriest}}
(\vpageref{redfallKeep})
she insists on walking slowly, behind the \glspl{pc}, so she can avoid danger.
Once she sees the state of the \gls{redfall} \glspl{keeper}, she plans to put them into an enchanted sleep.

\begin{speechtext}
  The curse affecting them will not lift until their bellies empty -- but that will take time.
  I need to find them calm, sleeping, and I can make them sleep for a while.

  You could tire them, hound them (but don't hurt them), until they become too tired to continue with any fight.
  Or perhaps fetch me some \glspl{ingredient}, and we could retreat, then return with a spell which will make everyone in the keep sleep.
\end{speechtext}

\Gls{forestpriest} remains open to any plans the \glspl{pc} come up with, but if they agree to find \glspl{ingredient} for her, she needs a Water and a Fate \gls{ingredient} to make a sleeping spell which will keep everyone in \gls{redfall} sleeping.
The spell must be cast while they are already asleep, but it works from far away, so the troupe simply need to wait until late at night.
Once she completes her \gls{casting}, the keep sleep soundly, and the \glspl{pc} can selectively wake the guards later, instructing them to be silent.

Of course, the entire keep now has the problem of keeping the noise level down, but that's \gls{redseneschal}'s problem, and he can handle it fine.

\segment{Roads}% AREA
{Rumours of the Beast}% NAME
{People on the road chatter about `the beast' who rides at night by \glsentrytext{redfall}}% SUMMARY
On the road, people discuss sightings of the `giant rider'.
In fact people have seen \gls{hungrywarden} riding his massive horse at night (he just rides for fun).

\paragraph{If the troupe kill or cure the \gls{redfall} \glspl{warden},}
skip the next \gls{segment}, and perhaps add some news about the aftermath (the players should hear about the consequences of whatever happened).

\segment[\gls{vlg}]{town}% AREA
{The \Glsfmttext{warden}'s Bounty}% NAME
{\Glsfmttext{townmaster} discovers \glsfmttext{hungrywarden} has become a beast, and puts a bounty on his head}% SUMMARY
\label{mastersBounty}

A guard at \gls{redfall} has fled, and informed the whole town that \gls{hungrywarden} has turned into a monster.
\Gls{townmaster} immediately declares him an illegal entity.

\begin{speechtext}
    Hear ye! Hear ye!

    Oi! I said ``Bloody well listen!''

    \begin{itemize}
      \item
      The current price of dwarvish coin is to be lowered by a tenth of the current value.
      \item
      \Glspl{sunGuard} no longer allowed to urinate\ldots in public.
      Guards caught urinating in public, may be reported, to the local {\footnotesize guard station}.
      \item
      Honest work is to be found digging fortifications for the Newarp \gls{village}.
      \index{Newarp}
    \end{itemize}

    It can wait till I'm bloody-well finished, Sootboil.
    Shut it!

    Listen good to this one!
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
      \Gls{hungrywarden} of \gls{redfall} Keep has turned-evil, become-a-depraved-monster, and is to be \underline{\large killed -- on -- sight}.
      \item
      His last known whereabouts is his own keep.
      Within this establishment, his own staff may be \emph{killed} on the basis that they harbour a criminal.
      \item
      All goods found therein are considered legal property by the finder.
    \end{itemize}
\end{speechtext}

Arkblow the crier knows nothing more than he's said.  A number of townsfolk quickly decide to take up arms and slay the local monster, hoping the ransack his house and loot anything of value.

Of course, the only way to put a stop to this is for the characters to find \gls{forestpriest} and bring her to the keep before the angry mob arrive, convince the mob that they have already cured \gls{hungrywarden}, or somehow rush the \gls{redfall} family to safety.

\paragraph{Stalling the impending trouble}
before it starts could involve extolling laws (\roll{Strength}{Academics}), pleading (\roll{Charisma}{Empathy}), or anything else.
However they approach the problem, the \gls{tn} is 12, but they should get at least three rolls for different actions before the townsfolk stop listening.

\paragraph{Journeying to \gls{redfall} before the crowd}
won't be a problem if they have horses.
If no horses are present, a few traders will arrive before them with \glspl{weapon}, and wait for the right moment to raid valuables.
