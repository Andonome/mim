\begin{boxtext}

  Two men are pummelling each other in front of the pub's door.
   One limps and the other's nose is burst open and streaming down his shirt, but they continue circling like boxers.
   Two guards cry out and run forward to stop the public disturbance, and the two men immediately run together into \gls{pig}, a disreputable tavern near the city's entrance.
   The guards stop at the door, look at each other for a moment, and then walk away.

\Gls{pig} never treats \glspl{guard} well.

\end{boxtext}
 
The roughest and oldest pub in \gls{town} sits in the heart of the slums, not far from \gls{town}'s entrance.

\Gls{pigowner}, keeps the place in order with a mixture of services for the roughest characters in \gls{town}, friendships with guild seniors, and rare -- but sudden -- violence.

When \glspl{sunGuard} complain about miscreants and knaves in the tavern, \gls{pigowner} reminds them that the tavern falls under the jurisdiction of the \gls{wheatGuild}, so she will take charge of keeping order in her own `temple'.
The fact that she spends most of her time drunk doesn't detract from her status as a Keeper, or stop the occasional noble asking her to sneak contraband into the city.

Currently, \gls{pig} allows a few of the \glspl{whiteBandits} to stay hidden, in rooms underneath the tavern, as they help her move things in and out of town without going through the \glspl{sunGuard} at the gates.%
\footnote{See page \pageref{farmExit} for the exterior route.}

\begin{boxtext}

  Joyful, out-of-tune song and roasted pig wafts hits you in the face as soon as the door opens.
  With only three tables in the room, people have carved out little seating circles on the ground.
  A fat, black-and-white cat with a brown collar sits in the rafters and eyes you suspiciously as you struggle through the disorganized crowd to get to the bar.

\end{boxtext}

\mapentry[pigHall]{Beerhall}

Here miscreants drink, except for Mog -- the cat -- who spends his time sitting on people and cleaning himself.

Roll $2D6$ to find the state of the tavern.

\begin{dlist}
  \item
  The kitchen is working!
  (a massive meal costs only 2~\glspl{cp})
  \item
  Mog has taken a liking to the \gls{pc} with the lowest \roll{Charisma}{Empathy} total, which means they receive free ale as long as they sit there, with Mog on their lap.
  \item
  \Gls{sewerking} drinks quietly in the corner.
  \item
  \Gls{alemaster} drinks in the corner with \gls{pigowner}.
  \item
  $1D6$ \glspl{whiteBandits} have arrive to enter room \vref{pigPrivate}, and then move underground.
  \item
  $1D6$ \glspl{whiteBandits} exit room \ref{pigPrivate} with some barrels, and placing them in room \vref{pigKitch}.
\end{dlist}

\paragraph{Any trouble here}
receives a vicious response from \gls{pigowner}'s most loyal customers.

\humanthief[\npc{\T[3]\Hu}{Loyal Patrons}]

\mapentry[pigKitch]{Kitchen}

\Glspl{server} of the \gls{wheatGuild} work here.
Staff turnover is very high, so the \glspl{pc} will not see the same faces twice.

\pigowner

\mapentry[pigPrivate]{Private Room}

\Gls{alemaster} often sleeps in \gls{pig}'s quieter side-room after a long night of drink and song.
She gets on well with \gls{pigowner}, helps with the books, and provides cheap ale to many of the taverns around.%
\footnote{Although, not all taverns, as the \gls{wheatGuild} of \gls{southDale} is cheaper.
See \autopageref{troubleAle}.}

\begin{boxtext}
  Perfumes, spices, and stale sex fill your noses.
  The wide room practically begs for shoes to be removed as it's filled with pillows, throws, and blankets.
  The only raised platform is a table strewn with fortune-telling cards, where \gls{alemaster} sits with a headband made of gold.
\end{boxtext}

Under \gls{alemaster}'s fortune-telling card table the floorboards are loose, and lead down to a new room, muffled by a thick curtain.
The number of people entering here has lead to wild rumours about the number of men \gls{alemaster} satisfies each day, and the number of hours they spend in there.
However, the reality is that everyone who enters the room simply wants to go through the secret hatch to the room below.

\alemaster

\mapentry[pigDen]{Thieves' Den}

The \glspl{whiteBandits} sit in the stale here here, playing card-games, and plotting how to avoid work.
A number of local thieves know of this secret and secluded room, but they will not feel eager to piss of \gls{pigowner}.

\begin{boxtext}
  Three men sit cross-legged on the floor, quietly playing cards.
  The second they see you, an additional layer of silence enters the room.
\end{boxtext}

\humanthief[\npc{\T[3]\Hu}{Three Cutthroats}]

\mapentry[pigRoom]{\Glsentrytext{pigowner}'s Room}

\Gls{pigowner} lives in a mess of old notes about what she owes to whom, chests of illegal weapons%
\footnote{Weapons are not illegal but stockpiling more weapons than an individual can use \emph{is}.}
hidden under various clothes (swords mostly), and various expensive alcohols, along with poisons, all lying about without labels.

\mapentry[pig_pantry]{Pantry}

\Gls{pigowner} stores additional casks of ale, the good wine, and the best salted pork in here.

\begin{boxtext}
  A little river can be heard ahead.
  It springs from a crack in a tunnel, to the right, and heads down a greasy slope into darkness.
\end{boxtext}

\mapentry[runoff]{Runoff}

Various little pipes, nooks, and gutters in the city lead underground.
A little drain from above pops out here, and heads steadily downhill, eventually landing in the sewers below (see area \vref{sewerPig}).

A gnomish \gls{server} who once worked here put up a wire guardrail in front of the running water, as a safety precaution.
However, she stood at half the height of a human, so the `guardrail' now functions as a tripwire.

The first member of the party to look down the tunnel rolls to spot the tripwire (\roll{Wits}{Vigilance}, \tn[8]), and failure means they immediately go tumbling downwards to the sewers.

\mapentry[pigShaft]{Ventilation Shaft}

This little tunnel reaches upwards to allow a modicum of fresh air to circulate down in the nasty little dungeon.
Characters with a Strength of 0 or greater are too large to fit through the narrow hole.
It emerges on a street, just below a rich man's house.

\mapentry[pigTemple]{\Glsentrytext{healersGuild}}

The old tunnels beneath \gls{town} allowed the \glspl{healersGuild} to port the bodies of the sacred dead down to their ossuaries.
\Gls{sewerking} has exploited this fact by creating a hidden entrance -- a loose stone, which permits entrance.
He uses the secret passage to kidnap ill people (mostly \glspl{warden}) from the \gls{healersGuild}, and turn them into ghasts.%
\footnote{See `\nameref{oldlibrary}', area \vref{oldlibrary}.}

\paragraph{Noticing the loose stone}
requires a \roll{Wits}{Crafts} roll (\tn[11]).

\mapentry[pigDogs]{Sleeping Dogs}

When not getting up to no good, the \glspl{whiteBandits} sleep in these little alcove-bedrooms.
Each one has little more than blankets and clothing hooks.

\Gls{sewerthief} has the room to the far right, and while everyone else was digging where \gls{sewerking} ordered, he quietly dug himself a little hiding-hole to stash money and other valuable he's taken for himself.
In total, he's collected \lootMedium, and one \lootMagic.

\showTalisman

When \gls{sewerking} found out about this, he became annoyed, and placed a ghast in the room, instructing it to frighten (but not kill) \gls{sewerthief}.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} enter \gls{sewerthief}'s room,}
the ghast jumps out at them.

\mapentry[pigDown]{The Descent}
This path downwards leads to the thieves' den underground (see page \pageref{sewerPigWalk}).
