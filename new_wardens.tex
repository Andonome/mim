\sqpart{Roads}% AREA
{\gls{vlg} Dry Inkwells}% NAME
{When every \glsfmtplural{jotter} lies dead, the troupe discover freedom}% SUMMARY

The \gls{whiteBandits} have finally pulled off their plan to have every \gls{jotter} in \gls{valley} killed in a single night.
The troupe find one such \gls{bothy}, with a short clue as to the culprit.

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{Underground Assassins}% NAME
{The bandits in the sewer cut \Glsentrytext{captain}'s throat}% SUMMARY

\textbf{Background:}
\Gls{captain} has been pushing the investigation into the undead and nura sightings in town, so \gls{sewerking} ordered a hit on him, lead by \gls{sewerthief}.
Five men walked casually about him as he returned home \gls{whitehorse} with his wife, then closed in so one could stab him in the neck.

\begin{boxtext}

  You hear guards shouting ``After them!'', in the distance, and quickly scurrying feet, as a woman shouts for someone to help her wounded husband.

\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If the characters stay to help the wounded man,}
they find \gls{captain} with a knife-wound, next to his wife.
The roll is \roll{Wits}{Medicine}, at \tn[9] to save his life.

\paragraph{If they run after the thieves,}
the \glspl{pc} make a Group Roll of Speed + Athletics.%
\iftoggle{core}%
  {\footnote{See the core rules, page \pageref{grouproll}, for Group Rolls.}}%
{}%
Remember that whoever's trying to patch up \gls{captain}'s bleeding neck won't be able to join the chase.

\paragraph{If the party follow the assassins underground,}
they run to the nearest entrance -- perhaps the butchers or \gls{pig}.
Go to page \pageref{sewers}.
Otherwise, this incident will remain a mystery.

If \gls{captain} survives, he has little idea of what's happening, although a little investigation could reveal what he's been asking about recently (\roll{Intelligence}{Vigilance} Teamwork Roll, \tn[10]).

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{Bandits Caught}% NAME
{The bandits who plagued the countryside have been imprisoned}% SUMMARY

\label{banditsCaught}

\textbf{Background:}
The \glspl{pc} have captured \gls{banditking} alive.

\begin{boxtext}

  Hear, ye!  Hear all!

  Bandits who roamed the highways, lead by a man known as \gls{banditking}, have been apprehended.  The leader shall be drawn and quartered by week's end, and his companions hanged that night.

  Bakers are henceforth forbidden from purchasing the flour of the Quennome region, and any found doing so will be charged with consorting with elves.

  The temple of Alass\"e invites any charismatic men or women to aid the festivities, as playwrites and attractive actors are required for the upcoming festivities (not you, Margaret!).

\end{boxtext}

\Gls{banditking} will not be killed by law enforcement.
Those in \gls{pig} will inform \gls{sewerking} long before, and the rescue will commence as the bandits in the sewer storm the guards' holding.
Meanwhile, if \gls{necromancer}'s lair survives, the other bandits await instructions there.

\humansoldier[\npc{\T[10]\Hu}{10 Bandits}]

The only way for the characters to secure \gls{banditking}'s demise it to watch the guards' station all night.
If they do so, ten bandits stage an attack during the night.

\paragraph{The Distraction} starts by using ogre dust in three places in town to distract the local guards.

The attack begins once there are only ten guards left in the station.
\Glsentrytext{sewerking}'s men arrive, ready to break everyone out underground and take off into the nearest entrance to the sewer.

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{The Dead Rise}% NAME
{\Glsfmttext{sewerking} releases ghouls upon the citadel}% SUMMARY

\textbf{Background:}
\Gls{sewerking} undead have finally finished digging the tunnel
\footnote{See page \pageref{citadelTunnel} for the underground tunnel.}
underneath \gls{town}'s citadel,
\footnote{See page \pageref{citadel} for the town's Citadel.}
where \gls{townmaster} lives.
He releases the undead, and guides them upstairs, through the dark halls.
As the \gls{guard} torches cast light on undead faces, each one makes a decision to stay and do their duty, or flee and live.

By this point, the undead horde numbers over a hundred, and the citadel has not prepared for anything like this.
It has perhaps twenty guards, and most of them work there because they seemed loyal, rather than capable.

\Gls{sewerking} leads his horde to the palace's main door with two ghasts to stop anyone exiting, and leaves the horde to slowly work its way up the stairs and rooms, killing anyone they come across.

Play the next available encounter first, then interrupt it with news of the citadel's attack.
Everyone can hear the screams from half-way across \gls{town}.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} intervene,}
they find \gls{sewerking} at the door, with much of his mana depleted already from fights with the guard.
He will flee to the sewers the moment he feels unsafe.

\sewerking

\humansoldier[\npc{\T[6]\E\Hu}{Palace Guard}]

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} pursue \gls{sewerking},}
he already has a cave-in prepared to block his escape, so he waits -- holding a piece of rope, tied around a beam.
As the \glspl{pc} round the corner, they can roll Wits + Crafts (TN 10) to notice the trap and retreat.
If they fail (or run through the trap anyway), they can roll Speed + Athletics (TN 10) to make it through anyway.

If both rolls fail, the roof collapses, inflicting 8 Damage, and 8 \glspl{fatigue}.
Digging someone out from under the rubble requires an Intelligence + Crafts roll (TN 12), and they don't have long before the person under the rubble dies from asphyxiation (no resting actions allowed).

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} want to run up the stairs and save \gls{townmaster},}
they have 8 rounds before the ghouls devour him, and will need to travel across 20 squares before reaching \gls{townmaster}'s room on the second floor.

\paragraph{If \gls{townmaster} dies,}
then his sons most likely die with him.
Leadership of \gls{town} `temporarily' goes to \Gls{captain} (or \gls{traitor} if \gls{captain} already died).
