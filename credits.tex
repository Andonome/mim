\subsection*{Overview}

This small campaign outlines scenarios for the BIND RPG.
\emph{But}, they have a special structure.
To learn more about the structure of BIND's \glspl{sq}, check out the book of \textit{Judgement}\iftoggle{judgement}{, \autopageref{sidequests}}{}.
To ignore the structure, just run these scenes once the \glspl{pc} reach anywhere in the area stated (villages, town, forest).

\noindent
All playtesting has focussed on them as a complete campaign for a \glsentrytext{guard} campaign.
But I'm sure they could work with a troupe consisting of three gnomes in a trench coat, \textit{mutatis mutandis}.
