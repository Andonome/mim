\noindent
This complete list of Side~Quests allows you to see which Side~Quests are available at a glance.
Once the PCs encounter some Side~Quest which combines with another, pick another Side Quest in the area to continue or start.

Remember to write a `\sqr' in front of the Side Quest encounters which have become available, and `\ding{55}'~out encounters which you've completed.
