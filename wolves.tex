\sidequest[Town,Roads,Forest]{Wolf Heads}
\label{wolfHeads}

\noindent
The characters hear of a guild crew travelling around, and eventually meet them.
This Side Quest is designed to run in the background, and flavour other encounters.

\Gls{beardedalemaster} gets into other shenanigans later, in \nameref{troubleAle}, \autopageref{troubleAle}.

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{\N \squash Rumours of Glory}% NAME
{The troupe hear about famous warriors in their area}% SUMMARY

The local gossip relates to how the local heroes, known as the \glspl{wolfhead}, recently protected a town from a goblin invasion.
They act like the adventurers of old, but officially take their orders from the \gls{wheatGuild} of \gls{southDale}, through \gls{beardedalemaster}.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item{There were around forty goblins.}
  \item{}
  The \glspl{wolfhead} stopped them with grease spells over the walls, so the goblins could not climb properly, leaving the archers time to pick off more.
  \item{The local village master refused to pay for goblin heads taken, claiming it would be illegal as it would count as him raising his own army.}
  \item{The troupe refused to gather payment from the local peasants, but have sworn a blood oath to kill \Gls{village} Master Cronblight.}
\end{enumerate}

This last rumour isn't entirely accurate -- the \glspl{wolfhead} are irritated with \Gls{village} Master Cronblight (see page \pageref{cronblight}), but have not sworn an oath to kill him.

Play this encounter at the same time as the next Side Quest part, and raise the local nura rating by 1.

\sqpart{Roads}% AREA
{Arm Wrestling}% NAME
{The characters meet the \glsfmtplural{wolfhead}}% SUMMARY

The \glspl{wolfhead} have just encountered ten chitincrawlers, and slew the lot.
They used a giant web spell, along with a lot of arrows.

They are tired, but unwounded, and are up for fun, so they went to a nearby village to drink.
Wherever the characters are, they encounter the \glspl{wolfhead}, who then challenge them to arm-wrestling contests, or magical contests.
The \glspl{wolfhead} will also speak about encountering goblins, both during the recent assault on \pgls{village}, and in general.
The games are mostly in good faith, but if the troupe have any obviously valuable items, Courtbile will attempt to steal it from them.

\paragraph{If the characters ever ask to team up}
Betslick refuses, saying it would put the Ale Guild in a difficult situation, but won't elaborate.

\paragraph{If the troupe ask about her interference with the local Ale Guild,}
she denies everything, while grinning like a kid who ate all the chocolates.

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{\N \squash Rumours of Ogres}% NAME
{The troupe hear more of the \glsfmtplural{wolfhead}}% SUMMARY

The characters hear more of the \glspl{wolfhead}, specifically about how they are looking for some abandoned temple to Qualm\"e, which could be the source of so many goblins in the area.
The locals generally believe the \glspl{wolfhead} will save them all.

Play this encounter at the same time as the next Side Quest on your list.

\sqpart{Forest}% AREA
{\squash Helping Hands}% NAME
{The troupe encounter the \glspl{wolfhead} again, who lend a hand}% SUMMARY

The \glspl{wolfhead} come across the troupe at the same time as another encounter.
If the troupe are in trouble, they come to save them.
If the troupe aren't, they may just walk together with them for safety.

\sqpart{Roads}% AREA
{A Cry for Help}% NAME
{The troupe find the \glsfmtplural{wolfhead} attacked by ogres}% SUMMARY

A dozen ogres ambushed the \glspl{wolfhead} on the road, and the troupe heard their cries in the distance.
By the time the troupe arrive (assuming they come towards the cries) Betslick is unconscious (-3 HP), and Courtbile is nearly dead (2 HP left).

Ten ogres remain alive.
Five are focussed on the remaining \glspl{wolfhead}, and the other five have decided to wait in the bushes to ambush the troupe (or if not the bushes, inside nearby houses, or anywhere appropriate).

\paragraph{\N If the troupe leave}
then the \glspl{wolfhead} die (raise the local Nura rating by 1 as the \glspl{wolfhead} can no longer help).
If the \glspl{wolfhead} survive, they will rest in \gls{town}, and be ready for any call to adventure, such as joining the fight against the nura in the future.

\paragraph{If the troupe rescue the \glspl{wolfhead},}
then the \glspl{wolfhead} can tell them about \gls{banditking}'s plan to create a blight, cutting \gls{valley} off from the rest of the kingdom.%
\footnote{See \autopageref{blightConspiracy}.}
They overheard the plan while stalking the Immortal Bandits.
They do not know where this portal exists, only that the bandits suspect it exists.
