\noindent
Trouble has arrived in \gls{valley}, as two new groups have arrived to make a grab for power.
Each faction has its own broad plans or habits, and each one reveals its various \glspl{npc} throughout these various Side~Quests.%
\exRef{judgement}{Judgement}{sidequests}

The Side~Quests introduce the \glspl{npc}, show shadows of future events, or simply create complications for the \glspl{pc}.
If any of these major \glspl{npc} die, another takes their place, so all of the Side~Quests below should play out, even if a couple of them perish before their plot matures.

\section{Side Quest Summaries}
\label{sqSummaries}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\noindent
Wherever the \glspl{pc} wake up, some new rumour, event, or calamity waits for them.
These are the Side~Quests which weave together to create the stories here.

If your campaign uses BIND's default setup, your \glspl{pc} have enlisted (or been enlisted) into the \gls{guard}, and sleep in \glspl{bothy} between the various \glspl{village} in \gls{valley}.

This complete list of Side~Quests allows you to see which Side~Quests are available at a glance, in each area.
Once the \glspl{pc} encounter some Side~Quest which combines with another, pick another Side Quest in the area to continue or start.

Many Side Quests start in the town, then change to the \glspl{village}, and back again.
This summary gives you an overview of what happens per-area.

Remember to write a `\sqr' in front of the Side Quest encounters which have become available, and `\ding{55}'~out encounters which you've completed.
