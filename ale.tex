\sidequest[Town]{The Trouble with Ale}

\label{troubleAle}

\noindent
\Gls{beardedalemaster} has been sending for alcohol supplies from the Shale, watering down the dwarvish brew, and selling it as regular ale.
She has made a killing in profits, and almost pushed out the regular Ale Guild.
\iftoggle{aif}{%
  \footnote{This organization is also known as the `temple of Alass\"{e}' -- see page \pageref{guilds} for more on divine monopolies.}%
}{}%
takes dwarvish ale to \gls{town}, then waters it down, and makes an absolute killing in profits.
\Gls{alemaster} isn't happy with his profits being cut into, so the two sides sabotage each other and shenanigans ensue.

\Gls{alemaster}, dresses his men as Knights%
\footnote{The term ``Knight'', is used by townsfolk for anyone in armour.
Guilds who travel need a lot of protection, as the roads are dangerous, and they general count as `knights'.}
from the faraway Ale Guild of the Shale, and has them cause trouble in order to give his rivals a bad name all around \gls{town}.
In retaliation, \gls{beardedalemaster}, dignitary to the Shale Ale Guild, destroys much of the local ale stores.

When not getting into trouble, \Gls{beardedalemaster} walks with the Wolf Heads%
\footnote{See page \pageref{beardedalemaster} for more on them.}
and drinks in \gls{whitehorse}.

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{The Drunken Knight}% NAME
{A knight of the local Ale Guild starts fights while pretending to be from the Ale Guild of the Shale}% SUMMARY

This encounter can easily slip into the background -- the knight has no interest in annoying the PCs, especially if they look well-armed.

\begin{boxtext}

  A rank wind blows through \gls{town}.
  From the street ahead a drunken man in full plate armour falls against a wall, before getting back up and shouting at passers by that they're pathetic for drinking elvish nonsense, and need a proper dwarvish drink.

\end{boxtext}

\ldots except, he's not a knight.
He's a member of the local Ale Guild.
He's acting drunk and showing a symbol of the Shale in order to give the rival sellers a bad reputation.

Players may notice he's pretending to be drunk with a Wits + Medicine Group Roll, or notice that his coat of arms isn't painted onto his breastplate quite right with a Wits + Academics Roll.
Both have TN 10.

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{\squash Ale Explosion}% NAME
{Barrels of Ale explode down the street}% SUMMARY

Play this encounter at the same time as the next on the list.

\begin{boxtext}

  Suddenly the house to your right explodes, and water rushes down the street, knocking aside stalls, women, two stray dogs, and sweeping the lot down the road.  It foams and froths like mad, and then you notice -- this isn't water, it's ale!

\end{boxtext}

The party can avoid being swept down the street by the storm with a Wits + Athletics roll, TN 8.

\textbf{Background:} The local Ale Guild found that the more ale is brewed in a batch, the cheaper it becomes.
They bought a few cheap houses around the city, and build massive barrels to house the ale in.
However, \gls{beardedalemaster} found where they're stored, and paid a few street-rat children to come in and mess the place up, pulling corks out of the barrels, and such.
Unfortunately, with just a little too much jostling and jumping on the barrels, the unstable equipment exploded.

\paragraph{If the PCs investigate,}
an Intelligence + Vigilance Team Roll, TN 10, will allow the characters to find the bodies of the children who started the problem, along with the fact that they were recently speaking with \gls{beardedalemaster}, who currently drinks in \gls{pig}.%

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{You Can't Drink Here}% NAME
{People jeer at envoys from the Shale Ale Guild and a fight breaks out}% SUMMARY

\begin{boxtext}

  A crowd is vomiting out of a pub, pushing six men out with them\ldots or rather three men and three dwarves, all heavily armed.
  The crowd shout for them to go back to the mountains and that they're not welcome in the area, but a dwarf, covered in metal from head to toe, and wearing the emblem of the Ale Guild from the Shale, lifts his metal visor and shouts back at them, listing a litany of laws concerning public houses and the rights of foreign Guild \gls{nomad}, with deafening volume.

  The crowd just jeer, making a large vein in the dwarf's head bulge while his face turns redder by the moment.

\end{boxtext}

A \gls{nomad} troupe of three men and three dwarves from the Shale are tired from a long day's walk, and need a rest and drink, but the townsfolk think of the Ale Guild from the Shale as nothing but troublemakers.

Laxen, the angry dwarvish head \gls{nomad}, has had enough of the bickering and feels tough in his full plate armour.
He has no idea that \gls{beardedalemaster} has been pulling stunts, such as destroying the stores of the local Ale Guild.

\paragraph{If the characters do nothing,}
the crowd at one point pelt Laxen with some old soup, and local ale.
He swings pokes at the jeering crowd with a weapon, and a fight breaks out instantly.
The group then flee the city, and all ale trade with the Shale stops.

\paragraph{If the characters try to de-escalate the problem,}
give them an appropriate roll.
They have time to try multiple tactics, from asking the crowd to calm down, to threatening to call the guard.
However, the crowd are very angry, so the default TN for the encounter is 10.

\dwarvensoldier[\NPC{\Dw\M}{\Glsentrytext{nomad} Laxen}{Double Braided Beard}{Strokes beard}{Experience}]

\humansoldier[\npc{\T[3]\Hu\E}{Joshua, Rachael and Rob}]

These two are heavy drinkers, and heavy fighters, but they will stop as soon as Captain Laxen gives the word.

\dwarventrader[\npc{\T[2]\Dw\M}{Mugin \& Thunin}]

\Gls{beardedalemaster} still drinks at \gls{pig}.  

\paragraph{Conclusion:} If the characters can track down \gls{beardedalemaster} and have her talk with \gls{alemaster} they might be able to make peace between the two groups.
In this case, crisis is averted, and the final part can be discarded.

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{\N\squash Dry}% NAME
{Guild fights have caused all ale supplies to run out}% SUMMARY

If the party did not manage to avert total disaster in the previous encounter, play this encounter together with the next Side Quest.

\begin{boxtext}

  Later that day, you can find no rest in a tavern.  The first has run out of ale, and the second.  Asking around, people are saying they've all dried up, and now serve nothing but foul water.  The town are becoming agitated.

\end{boxtext}

For the next two encounters, all social rolls have a -2 penalty, as everyone around is feeling irritable.

Meanwhile, townsfolk are drinking more and more unpurified water, all of which has been tainted by the sickness of the nura who live in the sewers.  Raise the local nura rating by 1.

There is no possibility to repair this damage once it's done, and no option to repair the situation any time soon.
