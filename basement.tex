\label{old_alchemy_basement}

\histEvent{5988}{09}{The alchemist, Inkparch, attacks those in Archwarp's alchemical gate, passes into undeath, then seals the alchemical library's basement door, and remains sealed and alone to the present}

\begin{exampletext}
  Like all advanced alchemists, Inkparch felt he was better than normal people, which was true in regard to alchemy, and false in regard to social skills.
  One particularly heated argument with the Dean of Forces escalated into a tantrum, then a fight, and eventually a battle.%
  \footnote{The Dean of Forces felt there was one gateway between Archwarp and Sixshade, while Inkparch counted two gateways -- one in Archwarp, and the other in Sixshade.}

  As his argument with the Dean became continuously more bitter, the two began an alchemical `jostling', which prompted the guards to come and break the situation apart.
  This escalated the situation even further, until Inkparch found himself engaged in a battle with the entire alchemical basement.

  At this point, Inkparch began a classic necromantic trick -- he cast \textit{Soul Specks}, so he could hold his breath, then twisted the air into a foetid smog, making everyone in the area choke.
  Finally, a Force spell sealed the mundane exit.

  This plan went excellently, until one of the guards stabbed Inkparch in the tonsils before his permanent death.
  Inkparch also died, but his necromantic spell ensured his soul remained fixed in place, and he could continue moving as a ghast, or perhaps `lich' (the only difference being alchemical knowledge).

  The first escape plan was to approach the alchemical gateway, and speak the words to open it -- `open to trade!'; this didn't work, due to his shattered larynx.
  The second plan was to cast \textit{Soul Specks} on the Dean of Forces, ensuring his survival, and have him speak the words to open the gateway; but of course the Dean said he would rather pass into undeath and sit there for a century than help Inkparch with anything.
  The third plan was to raise the corpses in the basement as ghouls, and try to tell the ghouls (in the silent language of the undead) how to speak the words `open to trade'.

  In a fuming (and inexpressible) rage, Inkparch decided to trap the gateway, so he could kill anyone coming to end him.
  With chains pulled from the laboratory, he bound the undead to the pillars in front of the alchemical gateway, so that once someone entered, they would pull against the chains, which would pull apart the pillars, and the ceiling would come crashing down.

  This plan has yet to fail, but the gateway has not opened in the centuries since the incident, and he has no idea why.
  And over those centuries, after someone barred the door from the \emph{outside}, flood-water slowly filled the basement.

  The ghouls here still make noises with what remains of their larynx, but not a single one has managed to properly utter the required sentence.
  As a result, the undead within the basement still chant the opening words of the gateway, but they can never get it right.
  Still they chant\ldots

  `\textbf{Opena trei\ldots opena trei\ldots}'
\end{exampletext}

The entire basement of the old alchemical laboratory is sodden with water, resting knee-height to a human.

\begin{boxtext}
  Looking down stairs, you see a hallway built for gnomes, lined with pillars, and with a black floor, then you correct yourself.
  Black water sits along the entire hallway, which looks like a floor.

  In the far darkness, you can just about see great double doors along the hall, to the right, before the rest of the hall goes black.

\paragraph{Wading through the water}
is difficult.
All movement rates are halved.

\paragraph{Darkness}
means someone must carry a torch for the group to see, and any torches dropped in the water instantly extinguish.

\paragraph{The cold water and foetid air}
each inflict \pgls{fatigue} each \gls{interval}.
Allowing the barrow to air out for \pgls{interval} means it only inflicts 1 \gls{fatigue} per \gls{interval}.

\paragraph{All doors}
have swollen due to the many years of water-logging.
Opening them requires a \roll{Strength}{Crafts} roll (\tn[10]).
As usual, each roll remains as-is, so if someone fails to open a door they will need to find a way to gather more strength, or better tools, or simply give up opening that door.

\paragraph{Narrow hallways}
make wielding long weapons challenging.%
\exRef{core}{Core Rules}{enclosedcombat}

\paragraph{The Dead Chant} when not in combat.
If they stand at the other end of a hallway, they chant.
If the characters lock them in a room, the dead stand outside and chant while clawing at the door.

\paragraph{Cave-ins} present a real danger here.  If the ceiling ever collapses while the characters are inside, the falling rocks from above at first deals $1D6-2$ Damage to everyone in the room, then $1D6-1$, and so on, increasing by 2 each round, until everyone exits or dies.

\mapentry[alchemyHall]{Dead in the Water}

The dozen ghouls in the hallway had nothing better to do than fall over and lie in the water.
The high peat concentrations have preserved their bodies very well, though it does make them very stiff.

This creates an unplanned (but excellent) ambush, as anyone moving inside will simply feel an `uneven' floor.
As they trample over the ghouls, they awaken them, and then the dead will stand up \emph{between} the characters.

Five ghouls rest at the start of the hallway, and another five later on.
A further five at the other end of the hallway begin walking towards them immediately.
The entire situation makes for the perfect ambush, though the dead have not planned for it.

\paragraph{If the party attempt to fell any pillars,}
have them roll \roll{Strength}{Crafts} (\tn[13], +2 Bonus for using ropes).
Once the pillars fall, the entire area collapses within two rounds.

\paragraph{If anyone searches the bodies,}
they find eight of the ghouls which were once \glspl{guard}.

\mapentry[alchemyEquipment]{Study Supplies}

\index[mana]{Fate!Rubies}
Almost all of the various \glspl{ingredient} alchemists rely on have gone rotten over the centuries.
However, two pouches of red ruby dust remain, which function as Fire \glspl{boon}.
\index[mana]{Fire!Ruby dust}

\begin{boxtext}
  The shelves in this wide room are full of smashed and broken equipment, but it looks generally alchemical.
  Brass beakers, glass beakers, jars with rotten mouthdigger babies suspended in unknown fluids, pots with mould leaching out, and alcohol-burners, litter the shelves.
\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{Characters who scour the room,}
can find valuable remains with a \roll{Dexterity}{Academics} roll.
They gain all items below the \gls{tn}.
On a draw, something slips from their hand, and into the much, so the player will know they can find the item if they somehow raise their result (perhaps with \pgls{restingaction}, over the course of \pgls{interval}).

\begin{boxtable}
  \textbf{Roll} & \textbf{Result} \\
  \hline
      9         &   \lootMedium\ in a rotten, leather bag. \\
      10        &   \lootBig\ worth of green topaz lying in the water. \\
      11        &   Ruby-dust leather pouch (Fire \gls{boon}). \\
      12        &   Ruby-dust leather pouch (Fire \gls{boon}). \\
      13        &   \lootJewellery, stashed in a waterlogged book. \\
\end{boxtable}

\mapentry[alchemyLibrary]{Library}
\index{Library!Ancient}

The books here have mostly become water-logged, and fallen to mould.
However, a few highly-valuable books remain with ink still on the page.
If handled roughly, the books will degrade to mulch.

Characters can roll \roll{Dexterity}{Academics} to rescue books.
Compare the results to the table \vpageref{libraryTable} -- they obtain \emph{one} book below the \glsentrylong{tn}, while a tie indicates that they have identified the book before accidentally manhandling it to destruction.

Looking over these books requires \pgls{interval}, and each of the players should decide if they want to roll a check themselves (so the group can recover more valuables faster) or if they want their character to search with another \gls{pc}, to perform a Team Action (which would usually a Bonus).

\mapentry[alchemyRooms]{Dark Pit}

\begin{exampletext}
  While Inkparch rampaged, the Dean of Forces locked himself in his room, but this did not save him from joining Inkparch in undeath.

  Neither wants to move, as all movement drains the undead of a little of their remaining energy, so they have spent the last couple of centuries communicating bitterly in the silence language of the undead, and occasionally playing chess against each other by memorizing a theoretical board.
\end{exampletext}

Inkparch remains where he began -- at the bottom of the stairs, now wholly covered in water.
The \glspl{pc} will almost certainly fail to notice the drop, and so Inkparch intends to wait for them, and drag down the first foot he perceives.
\emph{However}, the Dean of Forces has a hate-fuelled plan he's held onto for some time.

\begin{boxtext}
  These doors swing open effortlessly, showing a new room with three more doors; right, left and centre.
  Before you can take another step, the narrow double-doors to the right burst open, and a dead man, with black cavities for eyes, steps out\ldots
  he points emphatically at the water.
\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{The second any character enters,}
the undead Dean exits room~\ref{deanRoom} to warn them of the danger in the water.%
\footnote{The Dean can see the characters' lights through cracks in his bedroom's door.}

\paragraph{If anyone steps into the water,}
they can roll \roll{Dexterity}{Caving} (\tn[12]), or Inkparch gains a \gls{vitalShot}, which he uses to grab.%
\exRef{core}{Core Rules}{grab}
After that, if the character falls below 0~\glspl{ap}, they reflexively breathe in the foetid water, gaining 3~\glspl{fatigue}.

\mapentry[alchemySecret]{Secret Study}

Up the stairs the area remains dry, safe and eventually leads to a regular door (no roll required to open it).
Inside, the room contains tables with extremely old scrolls, dust, and a series of very out-of-date books on alchemical theory.

The \glspl{pc} can make another roll on the old books table \vpageref{libraryTable} (with a +2 Bonus if they have already rolled on it).

\begin{boxtext}
  The stairs reach up, and finally you step your muddy boots out of the water and along a cold, but dry corridor.
\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{Resting here}
causes no \glspl{fatigue}, as the place is not full of cold water.

A \roll{Wits}{Crafts} check, \tn[10], reveals a loose wooden board in the ceiling.
It used to be an exit to the ground floor of the town above, \vpageref{basementTrapdoor}, but now the upper floor is just the ground outside\ldots after a lot of digging upwards.

\begin{boxtext}

  The bricks fall away easily, revealing a full new room.  Two skeletons rest on a table, each clutching a book.

\end{boxtext}

\mapentry[alchemyGift]{Giftschrank}

\begin{exampletext}
  The two skeletons on the table have aged worse than the other corpses, as they were never preserved in the peat-water.
  They died of hunger rather than facing the dead they knew to be outside.
  One holds a book of poetry, and the other holds a book of Enchantment spells, which she never managed to understand before dying.
\end{exampletext}

The book on Enchantment spells contains various excellent spells.
It is worth 6~\glspl{gp}, while the book of poems is worth 4~\glspl{sp}.

\paragraph{Finding the words which unlock the gateway}
requires an \roll{Intelligence}{Vigilance} roll, \tn[9].
It's hidden among a dozen rather dull books on proper etiquette with alchemy, and accountancy books concerning what the guild brings in and what is can produce.

The door to the Summoning Room is only blocked by a crude wooden panel, so exiting only requires a kick

\paragraph{Spotting the hidden door from the outside}
requires a \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} (\tn[8]).

\begin{boxtext}
  The massive double doors slowly swing inwards, and the torchlight reveals a flooded hallway of six stone pillars, two enclaves, and a stairway leading up to a stage.
  The stage shows a grand stone arch, like a doorway, leading to darkness.
  You can see an writing across the top.
\end{boxtext}
\mapentry[summoningRoom]{Summoning Room}

%! More portal riddle details

\begin{exampletext}
  This is where the magic happened.
  When anyone said `open to trade', the gateway came to life and allowed tradesmen to go in and out.

  After Inkparch became resentful of the idea of someone killing him and using this place for their own benefit.
  He took a measure of chains from the equipment storage, and used them to tie up a number of ghouls to the pillars.
\end{exampletext}

\paragraph{If any of the players say the words out loud,}
so do their characters; the gateway opens and the ghouls in the room begin chanting along with them in unison.%
\footnote{As usual, speech costs 1~\gls{ap}, so if the ghouls are in combat once the words are spoken, the party should enjoy the unexpected advantage they get.}

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} remove the gemstones in the gateway,}
it breaks forever.
The gems are worth 30gp in total.

If undiscovered, the dead stand and begin their chant, then slowly walk towards the characters.

\paragraph{After 2 rounds,}
the dead stand up.

\begin{boxtext}
  You look behind, and note two-dozen dead men standing from the water and staring at you.
  Their skin has gone brown with age, and they look barely able to move.
  Each drags a chain behind it, tied around one of the entrance pillars.
  They pull together towards you, each uttering the same strange, chanting moan, and then stop as the chains go tight around the stone pillars.
\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If a pillar has six or more ghouls pulling at it,}
then it collapses after 3 rounds.

\paragraph{If a group of ghouls grab a character,}
they stop pulling at their chains and focus on attacking that character.
