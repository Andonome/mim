\label{whitehorse}
\index{Taverns}

\begin{boxtext}

  A massive man with a butter-tipped moustache throws a lanky man from the door.
  The lanky man recoils with a grimace, and shouts `you owe me my wages!'.

\end{boxtext}

\begin{exampletext}
  \Gls{sewerthief} took a job as a cook at \gls{whitehorse} to learn more about \gls{townmaster}, but \gls{townmaster} instantly took umbrage at his \glsentrytext{whiteplains} accent.
\end{exampletext}

Entry through deception requires a roll against Barkwind's \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} (\tn).
The players can roll anything as long as it relates to a reasonable plan.
Otherwise, he forgets their faces within a week.

The \glspl{pc} \emph{must} agree with Barkwind (the doorman) about \gls{sewerthief} (and about \gls{whiteplains} in general) before he agrees to let them in.

\mapentry[horseHall]{Drinking Hall}

The hall contains various \gls{village} \glspl{warden} playing games, and half a dozen local guards (sometimes including \gls{captain}).

\mapentry[horseKitch]{Kitchen}

The staff sleep here during long shifts.  The lack of proper ventilation makes the air difficult to breathe.

\mapentry[horseYard]{The Courtyard}

The courtyard usually contains a couple of carriages, and nobles playing ridiculous games.

\begin{boxtext}

  \Gls{townmaster} is running away from a coterie of chuckling men with his hands tied behind his back.
   A chicken runs out in front of him with a little paper hat.
   He lunges forwards and grabs the chicken in his teeth, then shakes it like a mad dog until it stops squawking.
   He gives a triumphant grin as the crowd clap and another man steps forward to have his hands tied.

\end{boxtext}

\mapentry[horseUpstairs]{Upstairs}

Upstairs contains two rooms, a load of equipment for the tavern, sleeping mats for favoured servants, and bookshelves.

The bookshelves contain rather a lot of history books, most focussing upon anti-elven propaganda, such as the time they destroyed \gls{lostcity}.

\Gls{beardedalemaster} and Courtbile of the \gls{wolfhead} sleep in the larger room.%
\footnote{See page \pageref{wolfHeads} for the Wolf Heads.}
\Gls{whitehorse} has no locks as nobody expects thieves to enter.
