If your troupe plough through too many \glspl{sq} in town, it might become barren and lifeless, forcing them into the \glspl{village} out of boredom.
And if you introduce too many \gls{sq} threads at once, chaos and confusion loom.
Players can only remember so many \glspl{npc} before they lose focus.
For these two reasons, a few random \glspl{sq} which lead nowhere, and don't have a wider tale to tell, sit at the bottom of the pile, waiting to catch players when they have nothing else to threaten them.

Look again at the list on \vpageref{sqList} and you'll see what I mean.
