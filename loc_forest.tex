\chapter{Hungry Forests}
\epigraph{Come now, my child, if we were planning to harm you, do you think we'd be lurking here beside the path in the very darkest part of the forest?}{Kenneth Patchen}

\noindent
Nobody thrives in the forest -- at best they survive.

A five mile journey into the forest means 5~\glspl{ep}, then the troupe can stop to eat, marking off their day's rations, or they can fast-march while hungry and tired, back home, with a total of 10~\glspl{ep}.
An encounter with some creature under those conditions can easily mean death.

As dusk falls, the world goes quickly dark, and finding the way back home becomes difficult.
Asking for an \roll{Intelligence}{Wyldcrafting} roll at \gls{tn} 14 is not unreasonable.

By night, the troupe can sleep without a fire in the warmer seasons.
But during normal weather, they will need a fire in order to get any real rest.
And of course, when it gets cold, a large fire becomes \emph{mandatory}.

Noise, fire, or anything else which might entice and excite the predators who live here, should prompt a roll of $1D6$ -- and on a `1', an encounter must occur.
