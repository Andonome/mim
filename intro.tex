\paragraph{Overview}

This small campaign outlines scenarios for the BIND RPG.
\emph{But}, they have a special structure.
To learn more about the structure of BIND's \glspl{sq}, check out the book of \textit{Judgement}\iftoggle{judgement}{, \autopageref{sidequests}}{}.
To ignore the structure, just run these scenes once the \glspl{pc} reach anywhere in the area stated (villages, town, forest).
