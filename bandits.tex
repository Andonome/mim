\sidequest[Town,Roads]{Entitlement}

\noindent
The \gls{whiteBandits} are a bandit ring with a difference.
Their magic rings make them semi-undead, and they sometimes use undead horses, which cannot gallop, but never tire, so they can raid for many miles around their haven.%
\footnote{See page \pageref{necromancers_lair} for more on their foetid living conditions.}

\begin{boxtext}
  In the far distance, a trading caravan approaches.
  You can see the head rider's massive moustache before anything else.
  Both coaches have the usual archer on the top, though they don't look like \glspl{guard}.

{\Glsentrytext{banditking} pulls a cart of stolen goods}% SUMMARY

\begin{exampletext}
  A month ago, \pgls{guard} Rider reported finding a ruined temple to \gls{traitor}.%
  \footnote{See \vpageref{necromancers_lair}.}
  \Gls{traitor} went with \gls{banditking} to investigate it, and they found some old, sacred, and valuable, statues, and \pgls{artefact}.%
  \footnote{See \vpageref{The Bladder Skull}.}
  They also received an arrow wound from \gls{necromancer}, the \gls{artefact}'s undead creator.

  \Gls{banditking} has decided to take it upon himself to deliver them to Lakeside by road, so he can avoid the heavy taxes levied in \gls{town}.%
  Lakeside always has someone willing to buy valuable items, without too many questions.
  \footnote{See \vpageref{lakeside}.}
\end{exampletext}

\setcounter{wounds}{2}

\banditking

\Gls{banditking} greets the troupe in a friendly way, and explains he's going to Lakeside to sell his wares for a `client'.
He refuses to divulge any information about this client, then begins hinting that if the troupe ever run into anything valuable, and need to sell it, he can be very discrete.

\begin{speechtext}
  If you brave warriors ever need to sell any paintings, my brother sits in the \gls{whitehorse}, in \gls{town}.
  Just ask for him, and they'll show you right in.%
  \footnote{This is simply not true -- \gls{sewerking} keeps a low profile.}

  Anyway, it's a dangerous road.
  Fancy turning the other way and joining me?
  You know, all the work you do in the \gls{guard} has real value.
  People don't tell you that enough, but you guys save everyone, every day, and nobody says `thank you'.
  Why don't you come and protect people on this road, instead of that one, and I'll say `thank you', at the end.
\end{speechtext}

%! What statues?
%! Maybe the artefact?

\Gls{banditking} then offers the troupe 1~\glspl{sp} per mile, in total, if they join him till Lakeside.
He will only travel by road, so he can avoid \gls{townmaster}'s taxes.

{The Deal}% NAME
{The \glsentrytext{whiteBandits} request help}% SUMMARY

The \gls{whiteBandits} have gotten in a fight with the \gls{guard}, and both sides have left in a bad state.
They don't like the idea of two bandit rings in the area, so they plan to follow the \gls{whiteBandits} quietly, and kill them in their sleep.

\begin{boxtext}

  As you top the next hill, a group of six men wheel round and ready their bows at you, before their commander calms them.

\end{boxtext}

\Gls{sewerking} has noted he's being followed, so when he sees the party, he acts friendly, pretends to be a member of the Weapons Guild from \Gls{whiteplains}, and hopes they can travel together until the danger has passed.
He explains the situation while telling them not to look behind (``the bandits might notice you've spotted them!''), and asks for their help in formulating a plan.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} ask more about his background,}
he tells them his current business is top-secret.

\paragraph{If the party agree to accompany the \gls{whiteBandits},}
then \gls{sewerking} stays with them for a day, but makes sure they do not follow him all the way to their secret home, and avoids town at all cost in case someone recognizes one of his men.

\paragraph{If the party push for a fight,}
they will have one.

{Hidden Eyes}% NAME
{Bandits watch the characters from the side of the road silently}% SUMMARY

\Gls{banditking} and twenty men hide in the dense trees on a hill, a mile away from the road.
They watch, quietly, for traders.
A single man, Inkbane, sits closer to the road, waiting to call like a pigeon if someone rich wanders onto the road, or call like a crow if an armoured troop wander along.

\begin{boxtext}

  The road through over to the hamlet is quiet, with only rustling trees, and a crow cawing in the distance.

\end{boxtext}

Nobody will bother the characters, unless they look both rich and unarmed.

Spotting the fake call requires a Wits + Vigilance roll, TN 10.

\paragraph{If the characters capture Inkbane,}
he claims to be a hunter, but spotting the lie is only TN 8 on a Wits + Empathy roll.
If they come for the rest of the bandits, they flee on horseback.

{The Feast is Cancelled}% NAME
{The \glsentrytext{whiteBandits} have raided \pgls{village} during a wedding}% SUMMARY

\textbf{Background:}
Jameson has announced that he will track down and personally behead the \gls{whiteBandits}.
He works in the \gls{guard} as a scout, and enjoys the patronage of his father -- \pgls{village} master.
Unfortunately the \gls{whiteBandits} heard of his plans, and know where he lives.

\begin{boxtext}

  The village looks like some kind of inverted funeral.
  A woman stands in a beautiful beige dress at a wooden alter to V\'{e}r\"{e}, consoled by a man wearing the traditional bright wedding hat.
  Three dead men lie at the altar's feet, including a priest.
  A crow attempts to land on one of the dead men, but a local man lunges at it, then gives chase, as if trying to chase the crow into the sky.

\end{boxtext}

The bandits are ten miles away, and can still be tracked with a Wits + Wyldcrafting roll at TN 10.
If the \glspl{pc} catch up to them, the bandits run away.

\paragraph{If anyone asks about why this happened,}
the villagers all tell them about Jameson's recent bravado.

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{Bandits Caught}% NAME
{The bandits who plagued the countryside have been imprisoned}% SUMMARY

\stopcontents[Town]

\textbf{Background:}
The \glspl{pc} have captured \gls{banditking} alive.

\begin{boxtext}

  Hear, ye!  Hear all!

  Bandits who roamed the highways, lead by a man known as \gls{banditking}, have been apprehended.  The leader shall be drawn and quartered by week's end, and his companions hanged that night.

  Bakers are henceforth forbidden from purchasing the flour of the Quennome region, and any found doing so will be charged with consorting with elves.

  The temple of Alass\"e invites any charismatic men or women to aid the festivities, as playwrites and attractive actors are required for the upcoming festivities (not you, Margaret!).

\end{boxtext}

\Gls{banditking} will not be killed by law enforcement.
Those in \gls{pig} will inform \gls{sewerking} long before, and the rescue will commence as the bandits in the sewer storm the guards' holding.
Meanwhile, if \gls{necromancer}'s lair survives, the other bandits await instructions there.

\humansoldier[\npc{\T[10]\Hu}{10 Bandits}]

The only way for the characters to secure \gls{banditking}'s demise it to watch the guards' station all night.
If they do so, ten bandits stage an attack during the night.

\paragraph{The Distraction} starts by using ogre dust in three places in town to distract the local guards.

The attack begins once there are only ten guards left in the station.
\Glsentrytext{sewerking}'s men arrive, ready to break everyone out underground and take off into the nearest entrance to the sewer.
