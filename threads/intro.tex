The first few \glspl{thread} prod and tease the players with big plots and \glspl{npc} who will become important later, then retreat, quietly, and invite the troupe to investigate.
\Pgls{fiend} rears her head as she raises a small army of \glspl{crawler}.
The \glspl{pc} hear about the \glspl{wolfhead}, then meet them one-by-one (but may not notice the connection yet).
And they meet \pgls{whiteBandits} leader, working as a fence, but will not understand his lust for power until later.
\index{Fences}

The players can't engage with everything, but must engage with something.
They should begin to develop `political opinions', even if the opinion is just `\textit{someone needs to kill that spider-elf-woman}'.

The first \gls{thread} begins in
\advanceTheDate[54]%
\setcounter{track}{\thefenestraDay}%
\divide\value{track} by 20%
\ifcase\thetrack%
  early
\or%
  mid
\else%
  late
\fi%
\showCycle, and each \gls{thread} assumes a slightly later start-date.
