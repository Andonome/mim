{\Glsfmttext{greentower}}% NAME
{The Woodspy Bandits are setting up a secret operations base}% SUMMARY

Deep in the forest, \gls{townmaster} has commissioned masons to secretly start building a single tower from the fallen stone of \gls{lostcity}.
\footnote{See page \pageref{expanding_wilderness} for more on \glsentrytext{townmaster}'s motivations.}
This is the first foray into the deep wilderness.
The top is to be disguised by painting it green (the colouring is made by malachite, which can be expensive).

\begin{boxtext}

  In the deep forest, where there should really be nothing, you see a little tower, and a man hanging out the window, painting it green.
  With another day of painting, the green tower could have been made almost invisible from a distance.

\end{boxtext}

Half of the masons are active members of the Woodspy Bandits, lead by \gls{traitor}.
The other masons are aware they must keep the project a secret, but think that they work for the king, at least indirectly.
As a result, the group cannot attack the \glspl{pc} without some way to explain their behaviour to the regular masons.

At this stage it's unlikely that they find the secret portal to catacombs of the old Temple of Qualm\"{e}, as the builders have no idea what lies under their feet.
However, it is possible for them to discover this information by obtaining old maps of \gls{lostcity}.

\paragraph{While the troupe introduce themselves,}
The tower is assaulted by a basilisk.
If the characters seek sanctuary in the tower, the workers will let them in, unless there is a good reason not to.
See page \pageref{green_tower} for the layout of \gls{greentower}.

The basilisk will remain outside for a day, and its stench quickly drives all the bandits to the top of the tower, where the swords are stored.
At this moment, \gls{traitor} realises the illegal swords sit in plain view, whether or not the troupe realize he is a traitor.

\paragraph{If the troupe have met the Woodspy Bandits before,}
they can spot these are the same people with a Wits + Empathy Team Roll.%
\exRef{core}{Core Rules}{teamwork}

\paragraph{The Woodspy Bandits may also recall the characters}
(with the same roll).
If they do indeed recall who the characters are, they will try to attack by surprise in order to keep the characters from spilling their whereabouts to anyone.
A slow conspiracy develops within the keep, as each one gets called away to whisper with the others, one by one, until they all agree to let the characters spend the night there, and stab them in their sleep.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} bring news of \gls{greentower}'s location to the \gls{guard},}
footnote{See page \pageref{guardstation} for more on the guard station.}
then the Woodspy Bandits will be chased out of the area, in due time, once all the necessary paperwork has been completed.

\paragraph{If anyone in the troupe can use mana,}
they feel magical energy recharging them from below constantly (3 MP per turn).%
\footnote{See page \pageref{underGreenTower} for details on the tunnels below.}

\paragraph{Take a pen,}
and add the tower to your map of the area, wherever the troupe happen to be in the forest.
