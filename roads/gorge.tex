  The road ahead descends, while craggy hills rise at the side.
  The stony walls make the road gradually narrower, leaving only enough room for a single cart, and shade the muddy basin from direct sunlight.

If two trading caravans meet in the narrow centre, one will have to back-track, which is not easy with horses, especially as the gorge goes on for almost a mile.

One solution is to shout before entering the gorge, but this brings the danger of monsters, which will most likely come from behind the wagon\ldots or from above.
Another solution is to send scouts ahead.
This works well, as long as enough archers remain in each group to protect everyone.

Traders enter here rarely, as few have enough archers to enter safely.
As a result, trade has dwindled in the local \gls{village} (which is also now known as `Silent Gorge').
